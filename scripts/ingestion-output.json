    "content": "High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action — 24 October 2025\n\nHigh-risk jurisdictions have significant strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and financing of proliferation. For all countries identified as high-risk, the FATF calls on all members and urges all jurisdictions to apply enhanced due diligence, and, in the most serious cases, countries are called upon to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing (ML/TF/PF) risks emanating from the country.\n\nJurisdictions subject to a FATF call for countermeasures:\n\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)\n\nThe FATF remains concerned by the DPRK's failure to address the significant deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the serious threats they pose. The FATF has noted that the DPRK has increased connectivity with the international financial system, which raises proliferation financing risks. The FATF reaffirms its 25 February 2011 call on its members and urges all jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with the DPRK, including DPRK companies, financial institutions acting on behalf of the DPRK, and those who act on their behalf. The FATF applies countermeasures to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risks emanating from the DPRK.\n\nIran\n\nIn June 2016, Iran committed to address its strategic deficiencies. Iran's action plan expired in January 2018. In February 2020, the FATF noted Iran has not completed its action plan. Iran will remain on the FATF statement on High Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action until the full action plan has been completed. Iran reported in January, August and December 2024 and August 2025 with no material changes in the status of its action plan, and has failed to address the majority of its action plan since 2016. The FATF calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective countermeasures. The FATF further calls on jurisdictions to apply the specific countermeasures of:\n- Refusing the establishment of subsidiaries or branches or representative offices of financial institutions from the country concerned, or otherwise taking into account the fact that the relevant financial institution is from a country that does not have adequate AML/CFT systems; and\n- Prohibiting financial institutions from establishing branches or representative offices in the country concerned, or otherwise taking into account the fact that the relevant branch or representative office would be in a country that does not have adequate AML/CFT systems.\n\nJurisdiction subject to a FATF call to apply enhanced due diligence proportionate to risks:\n\nMyanmar\n\nIn February 2020, Myanmar committed to address its strategic deficiencies. Given the continued lack of progress, the FATF calls on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced due diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. Myanmar will remain on the list of jurisdictions subject to a call for action until its full action plan is completed. If no further progress is made by February 2026, the FATF will consider countermeasures. When applying enhanced due diligence, countries should ensure that flows of funds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are neither disrupted nor discouraged. The FATF will also continue to monitor whether Myanmar's AML/CFT activities apply undue scrutiny to legitimate financial flows.",

When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring.\n\nThe FATF and FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) continue to work with the jurisdictions below as they report on the progress achieved in addressing their strategic deficiencies. The FATF calls on these jurisdictions to complete their action plans expeditiously and within the agreed timeframes. The FATF does not call for the application of enhanced due diligence measures to be applied to these jurisdictions, but encourages its members and all jurisdictions to take into account the information presented below in their risk analysis.\n\nThe FATF identifies the following countries:\n\nJurisdictions with strategic deficiencies (as at 24 October 2025):\n\nAlgeria\nAngola\nBolivia\nBulgaria\nCameroon\nCôte d'Ivoire\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nHaiti\nKenya\nLao PDR\nLebanon\nMonaco\nNamibia\nNepal\nSouth Sudan\nSyria\nVenezuela\nVietnam\nVirgin Islands (UK)\nYemen\n\nJurisdictions no longer subject to increased monitoring (removed October 2025):\n\nBurkina Faso\nMozambique\nNigeria\nSouth Africa\n\nThese four jurisdictions are no longer subject to the FATF's increased monitoring process after substantially completing their action plans, including by having addressed or making significant progress in addressing the key recommended actions in their mutual evaluation reports.",

\no address of mass registration; \no only a post-box address; \no no real business activities being undertaken; \no the exclusive transit of transactions with no wealth or income being generated; \no no personnel (or only a single person as a staff member); \no lack of payment of taxes, superannuation, retirement fund contributions or social \nbenefits; \no no physical presence; \n• loss-making transactions where the loss is avoidable or readily accepted;  \n\n \n \n• dealing with money or property where you suspect that either is being transferred to \navoid the attention of a trustee in a bankruptcy case, HMRC, or a law enforcement \nagency;  \n• transactions which appear to be complex or unusually large;  \n• unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic purpose; \n• transactions are unusual because of their size, nature, frequency or manner of \nexecution; \n• significant differences between the declared price and the approximate actual values \nas judged either by the legal professional or in respect to some reference; \n• type of operation being conducted is clearly inconsistent with the size, age, or activity \nof the legal entity or natural person acting; \n• creation of complicated ownership structures; \n• involvement of structures with multiple countries where there is no apparent link to \nthe client or transaction; \n• incorporation and/or purchase of stock or securities of several companies, \nenterprises or legal entities within a short period of time with elements in common;  \n• there is an absence of documentation to support the client’s story, previous \ntransactions, or company activities; \n• there are several elements in common between a number of transactions in a short \nperiod of time; \n• back-to-back property transactions (for example, within six months), with rapidly \nincreasing value or purchase price;  \n• abortive transactions with no concern for the fee level or after receipt of funds;  \n• the retainer exclusively relates to keeping documents or other goods, holding large \ndeposits of money or otherwise using the client account; \n• a lack of sensible commercial/financial/tax or legal reason for the transaction;  \n• a power of attorney is sought for the administration or disposal of assets under \nconditions which are unusual; \n• investment in immovable property, in the absence of any links with the place where \nthe property is located and/or of any financial advantage from the investment;   \n• services where legal professionals, effectively acting as financial intermediaries, \nhandle the receipt and transmission of funds through accounts they control in the act \nof facilitating a business transaction;  \n• services that allow clients to deposit/transfer funds through the legal professional’s \ntrust account that are not tied to a transaction which the legal professional is \nperforming;  \n• services where the client may request financial transactions to occur outside of the \nlegal professional’s trust account;  \n• services requested by the client for which the legal professional does not have \nexpertise unless the legal professional is referring the request to an appropriately \ntrained professional for advice; \n• services that rely heavily on new technologies that may have inherent vulnerabilities \nto exploitation by criminals, especially those not regulated for AML/CFT;  \n• transfer of real estate or other high value goods or assets between parties in a time \nperiod that is unusually short for similar transactions with no apparent legal, tax, \nbusiness, economic or other legitimate reason;  \n• payments received from un-associated or unknown third parties and payments in \ncash where this would not be a typical method of payment; \n• transactions where it is readily apparent to the legal professional that there is \ninadequate consideration, especially where the client does not provide legitimate \nreasons for the amount of the consideration; \n\n \n \n• administrative arrangements concerning estates where the deceased was known to \nthe legal professional as being a person who had been convicted of crimes that \ngenerated proceeds;  \n• unexplained establishment of unusual provisions in credit arrangements that do not \nreflect the commercial position between the parties;  \n• transfer of goods that are inherently difficult to value, where this is not common for \nthe type of client, transaction or the legal professional’s normal course of business; \n• acquisitions of businesses in liquidation with no apparent legal, tax, business, \neconomic or other legitimate reason;  \n• services where the legal professional acts as a trustee/director that allows the client’s \nidentity to remain anonymous; or \n• commercial, private or real property transactions or services to be carried out by the \nclient with no apparent legitimate business, economic, tax, family governance, or \nlegal reasons.  \n18.4 Trusts and Administration of Estates \n \n• Purpose of the trust is unclear (trusts can be used to evade tax and hide criminal \nproperty); \n• unusual structure or jurisdiction;  \n• unexplained use of express trusts, and/or incongruous or unexplained relationships \nbetween beneficiaries and the settlor; \n• settlor was accused or convicted of acquisitive criminal conduct, improperly claimed \nwelfare benefits or had evaded the due payment of tax during their lifetime; \n• assets earned or obtained in a high-risk jurisdiction; \n• unexplained or incongruous classes of beneficiaries in a trust; or \n• discrepancy between the supposed wealth of the settlor and the object of the \nsettlement.  \n18.5 Property work  \n \n18.5.1 Ownership issues \n \n• Properties owned by nominee companies or multiple owners may be used as money \nlaundering vehicles to disguise the true owner and/or confuse the audit trail; or \n• sudden or unexplained changes in ownership. (Flipping, involves a property \npurchase, often using someone else’s identity which is then quickly sold for a much \nhigher price to the same buyer using another identity. The proceeds of crime are \nmixed with mortgage funds for the purchase. This process may be repeated several \ntimes.) \n18.5.2 Funding Methods \n \n• Transactions that do not involve a mortgage have a higher risk of being fraudulent, \nthough a payment being made through the mainstream banking system is not \nguaranteed to be clean;  \n• large payments from private funds, especially if your client has a low income and \npayments from a number of individuals or sources;  \n• funds are supplied by a third party; or \n• checks on the source of the funding can be more difficult where they involve direct \npayments between buyers and sellers. \n\n \n \n18.5.3 Valuing \n \n• A significant discrepancy between the sale price and what would reasonably be \nexpected for such a property to sell for.  \n18.5.4 Lender issues \n  \n• A client may attempt to mislead a lender client to improperly inflate a mortgage \nadvance – for example, by misrepresenting the borrower’s income or because the \nseller and buyer are conspiring to overstate the sale price.  This is mortgage fraud, \nand the mortgage advance will be the proceeds of crime; or \n• loans which are not at arms’ length may require particularly close consideration.  \n \n18.5.5 Tax issues \n  \n• If the purchase price is recorded incorrectly, this may be in an attempt to evade \nstamp duty (the saving would represent the proceeds of crime.) \n \n18.5.6 Charities \n \n• If registered with the Charity Commission, a charity is likely to be lower risk; \n• if you are asked to receive money on the charity's behalf from an individual or a \ncompany donor, or a bequest from an estate, be alert to unusual circumstances \nincluding large sums of money; or \n• there is growing concern about the use of charities for terrorist funding. HM Treasury \nmaintains a consolidated list of individuals and entities to whom you may not provide \nfunds, economic resources, and in relation to terrorism, financial services.  \n18.6 Company and Commercial Work   \n \n18.6.1 Formation of private equity funds  \n \n• Generally private equity work will be considered at low risk of money laundering or \nterrorist financing. Factors which may alter this risk assessment include:   \n \no where the private equity sponsor or an investor is located in a jurisdiction which is \nnot regulated for money laundering to a standard which is equivalent to the 4th \nDirective;  \no where the investor is either an individual or an investment vehicle itself; or \no where the private equity sponsor is seeking to raise funds for the first time.  \n \n• Whether an unregulated private entity firm, fund manager or other person involved \nwith the transaction is an appropriate source of information regarding beneficial \nownership of the client should be determined on a risk-based approach. Issues to \nconsider include: \n \no the profile of the private equity sponsor, fund manager, or such other person;  \no their track record within the private equity sector; or \no their willingness to explain identification procedures and provide confirmation that \nall beneficial ownerships have been identified.  \n\n \n \n18.6.2 Collective investment schemes \n \nThe risk associated with a collective investment scheme may be decreased where:   \n• the scheme is only open to tax-exempt institutional investors;  \n• investment managers are regulated individuals or entities; or \n• a prospectus is issued to invite investment.  \n \nFactors which will increase the risks include where:   \n• the scheme is open to non-tax-exempt investors;  \n• the scheme or its investors are located in a jurisdiction which is not regulated for \nmoney laundering to a standard which is not equivalent to the currently applicable EU \ndirective; or \n• neither the scheme nor the investment managers are regulated and do not conduct",

The Proceeds of Crime Act \n2002 requires you to report suspicious transactions. \n \nThis section highlights a number of warning signs or “red flags” for legal professionals \ngenerally and for those dealing with particular types of work, to further help you assess the \nAML risks associated with your practice, or risks of a particular client or matter appropriately \nand also to help you decide whether you have reasons for concern or the basis for a \nreportable suspicion.  \n \nBecause money launderers are always developing new techniques, no list of examples can \nbe exhaustive or fully comprehensive; however, below are some key factors which may arise \nduring or after client and retainer acceptance and give you cause for concern.  \n \nIf you become aware of a red flag, this should prompt to you to ask for additional \ndocumentation or ask further questions of your client.  For any aspect of an instruction, good \nquestions to ask are, “Does this make sense?” and, “Is the documentation I have consistent \nwith what I am being told and know about the background, nature or circumstances of the \nclient?”  If the answer is no, then consider what further information or documentation you \nrequire in order to become satisfied. If you cannot be satisfied, you consider your position in \nterms of proceeding with the relationship or matter, as per r.30., and consider the \nsubmission of a suspicious activity report.  \n \nThe presence of any one red flag does not mean that a client is automatically high risk, that \nyou should not continue with the retainer or that you need to make a Suspicious Activity \nReport. The presence of red flags must be considered in context; the client may be able to \nprovide a legitimate explanation.  For example, a large transaction by an oil company points \nto high risk, but actually it may be a normal and regular occurrence for that particular client’s \nindustry and business activities, and for your law firm.  Remember, it is not “tipping off” to \nask for further information as part of your client due diligence process.  \n \nIf you cannot get the information you need, this may in itself be cause for further concern \nand lead you to become suspicious. \n \n18.2 Examples of Red Flags \n \nIn collating these red flags, reference has been made to The FATF Report on Money \nLaundering and Terrorist Financing Vulnerabilities of Legal Professionals (2013) and The \nFATF Guidance on Concealment of Beneficial Ownership (July 2018) as well as other, \nsimilar pieces of guidance.   \n \n18.2.1 The Client \n \nIf a client: \n• is excessively obstructive, secretive or unwilling to meet you;

You should consider this \nalong the following lines: \n• The proportion and characteristics of clients you do not meet face to face or do not \nverify with robust electronic identification and verification; (EID&V) \n• How many of your matters rely on indirect contact with your client (e.g., via a \nrepresentative or agent) rather than holding a direct relationship with the client; \n• How much of your activity is delivered online or via any other channel that may \nfacilitate anonymity; and \n• The methods used to undertake identification and verification and general due \ndiligence requirements. \n5.6.4.1 Acting for individual clients without meeting them \n \nYou should consider this as a risk factor when you carry out your PWRA. You should also \nconsider how you mitigate the risk, for example by using an EID&V platform. It may also \nextend to the remote methods (e.g., telephone, email, live video) you use to contact your \nclient, as not all methods provide the same level of anonymity. Contact that is limited to text-\nonly should be considered as higher risk. \n \nWhen you act for clients without meeting them you must be satisfied that it makes sense in \nall the circumstances that you have not met the client and you should be comfortable that \nyou can mitigate the risks of identity fraud. You should consider whether any form of \nEnhanced Due Diligence may be appropriate. \n \nUse of an appropriate EID&V platform to mitigate the risks of not being able to meet a client \ncan be helpful but is not in itself a guaranteed or automatic solution to these challenges. A \nclear understanding of the limitations of such tools is needed if they are to be used correctly. \nSee Section 7 for more information on this.",

It may also extend to considering any social, \ncultural or language ties which might increase a link to a known high risk jurisdiction country \nor geographic area. \nIn assessing this risk at PWRA level, you may want to consider the following questions: \n \n• Does the practice operate outside of the UK/EU or equivalent jurisdictions \n(i.e., those where AML regulation may not be comparable) and/or in areas \nwith potentially higher levels of corruption? \n• Does the practice receive funds from jurisdictions outside the UK/EU or \nequivalent jurisdictions (i.e., those where AML regulation may not be \ncomparable? \n• Does the practice have a specific client-base, niche or undertake work for \nclients from outside of the UK/EU or equivalent jurisdictions (i.e., those where \nAML regulation may not be comparable)? \n \n5.6.2.1 Higher Risk Jurisdictions \n \n R33(3)(a) defines high-risk third countries (HRTCs) as those which appear on the following \nlists maintained by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF): \n• Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring \n• High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action. \nThese lists are set out here. \n\n \n \nYou will need to make sure that you stay up to date with these lists. Any amendments will be \nmade in February, June or October each year at the conclusion of a FATF plenary session. \nYou can check and diarise the exact dates on FATF’s events calendar. LSAG members may \nalso alert their regulated populations to changes.  \nThe Regulations mandate prescriptive steps where your client is established in a HRTC or in \nrelation to any relevant transaction, as defined at R33(3)(b), where either of the parties to the \ntransaction is established in a HRTC. Please see Section 6 for more on this.  \nYou should note that there may be other jurisdictions that present a high risk of money \nlaundering that are not on this list. \n \nResources to help you consider whether a country is high risk include:  \n• FATF and HM Treasury statements on unsatisfactory money laundering controls in \noverseas jurisdictions; \n• Transparency International's corruption perception index;   \n• The Basel AML Index; \n• CIA World Factbook; \n• U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports (INSCR); \n• FATF Jurisdictional Information; and \n• The Know Your Country rating table. \n \nFATF in particular provides a source of valuable information on the relative risks associated \nwith particular jurisdictions in its system of mutual evaluations, which provide an in-depth \ndescription and analysis of each country’s system for preventing criminal abuse of the \nfinancial system. It also produces a list of jurisdictions with ‘strategic deficiencies’ in their \nmoney laundering initiatives and a list of jurisdictions with 'low capacity', the latter being \ncountries which have economic or sociological constraints preventing them from \nimplementing AML/CTF measures effectively. \n \nIn addition, information is publicly available regarding countries that present bribery and \ncorruption risks and those regarded as secrecy jurisdictions or jurisdictions that permit the \nuse of nominee shareholders.  \n \nThe consolidated sanctions list, also details the countries in which sanctioned individuals \nand organisations are based, which may also provide an indication of the relative risk of \neach jurisdiction.  \n \nYou should list all of the countries to which your practice is exposed in your PWRA and give \na risk rating to each one. Being exposed to a country includes offering services, facilitating a \nmatter involving or having clients established in that country. \n \nFor the avoidance of doubt, prohibiting clients from outside of the UK or that are not UK-\nnationals, is not a requirement of the Regulations. Geographic risk is primarily associated \nwith jurisdiction, which may or may not extend to a client that has exposure to that \njurisdiction, depending on the circumstances.  \n \nIt is important to consider the levels of exposure your practice and any clients may have to \nhigher risk jurisdictions. For example, a practice that has a significant proportion of its \nbusiness connected to or in association with a country of higher risk, may have a greater risk \nexposure than a practice that only has one client, who uses only some ancillary services \nfrom that same jurisdiction. Practices should consider this along with the relative risks posed \n\n \n \nby the legal services offered to clients from such jurisdictions. On the other hand, experience \nof working in a high-risk jurisdiction can help practices to identify risks, while those with only \na minor exposure may lack such experience and may struggle to correctly identify risks. \n \nIncreasing globalisation means the likelihood that the work you do will involve other \njurisdictions and the international dimension may not always be obvious. You should bear \nthis in mind when assessing geographic risks and whether a client or matter may involve a \nhigher risk jurisdiction. \n \nCountry risk factors should feature prominently in a practice-wide risk assessment. Key \nissues to consider are whether the jurisdictions in which your clients, or the beneficial \nowners of your clients, are based or operate their businesses. \n \n5.6.2.2 Indicators of lower risk: \n \n• has stable, strong and independent political and legal systems, with legally \nprotected commitments to transparency, accountability and integrity across the \nkey institutions of government; \n• has compulsory suspicious activity reporting requirements in the regulated \nsector; \n• money laundering is criminalised, on a wide basis (e.g., all-crimes approach or \na specific list), and an effective sanctions regime is in place; or \n• the country has transparency of beneficial ownership disclosure requirements \nand an established financial intelligence unit. \n \n5.6.2.3 Indicators of higher risk: \n \n• has deficient anti-money laundering legislation, systems and practices and/or \ninadequate AML supervision; \n• has high levels of acquisitive crime or higher levels of corruption; \n• are a jurisdiction where the production of drugs, drug trafficking/trade, terrorism \nor corruption is prevalent; \n• are considered to be 'offshore financial centres' or tax havens; \n• permit nominee shareholders to appear on the share certificate or register of \nowners; or \n• local requirements around company structure or equivalent governance are \nunclear or otherwise make it challenging to understand the control structure of \nan entity. \nWhere your clients or the beneficial owners of your clients are based or operate their \nbusiness in low-risk jurisdictions this should also be reflected in the PWRA. \n \nIt is also important to consider whether your practice is involved in multi-jurisdictional \nmatters. Money launderers are commonly attracted to matters which move money or value \nacross borders, in order to obscure ownership and frustrate investigations.  \nIf you do not have the ability or expertise to effectively assess the risk posed by a particular \njurisdiction, you should consider whether it is appropriate to continue to act in relation to \nclients or matters associated to those jurisdictions.  Please note that jurisdictional risk is not \nan assessment of a client’s nationality. Not accepting business solely due to a client’s \n\n \n \nnationality is unacceptable and may lead to charges of discrimination and/or create access \nto justice issues for your practice. \n \nIt may also be necessary to consider risks posed by non-nations that for whatever reason \nmay pose a different risk to the nation within which they sit, e.g., regional jurisdictions such \nas Darfur in Sudan.",

Property matters are \nan attractive method of laundering criminal proceeds because: \n• Property is often a high value asset – it offers the opportunity to legitimatise large \namounts of money in one go; \n• The value of property generally appreciates – this is unusual for criminals who \nusually lose money when laundering; \n\n \n \n• The nature of conveyancing means that matters/transactions often happen extremely \nquickly – and therefore it is easier to hide behind a complicated money trail which \ncan be constructed very quickly, and the onward sale of a property can give the \nappearance of a legitimate income stream; \n• Property can be used to generate additional quasi-legitimate income streams e.g., \nrental; and \n• Property can be used by the money launderer or an associate as a residence.  \n \nTransfers of real estate from one owner to another without the exchange of funds, may \npresent an equal risk to the purchase of property. \n5.6.3.2 Client accounts and payments \n \nYou should consider the risk that criminals may attempt to misuse your client account. \nPutting the proceeds of crime through your client account can give funds the appearance of \nlegitimacy, as the subsequent transfer will show as having originated from a regulated legal \npractice. It will also help obscure the audit trail of funds whether the money is sent back to \nthe client, on to a third party, or invested in some way. \n \nIntroducing cash into the banking system can be part of the placement stage of money \nlaundering. The risk of this occurring, along with the controls in place at the practice to \nprevent this happening, should form part of your PWRA. \n \nGenerally speaking, you should avoid accepting cash payments to your client account in \nrelation to transactions. If you do choose to accept these as a policy of your practice, it \nshould be considered high risk within the PWRA particularly where large in size (e.g., above \n£1,000). At a client or matter level, you should establish Source of funds for any cash \npayments and treat the funds on a risk sensitive basis. There may be valid reasons for \naccepting cash into the client account (e.g., access to justice or in cases of domestic \ndisputes) – reasons for accepting any cash payment should be clearly documented. \n \n5.6.3.3 Formation and management of trusts and companies  \n \nCompany and trust structures may be exploited by criminals who wish to retain control over \ncriminally derived assets while creating impediments to law enforcement agencies in tracing \nthe origin and ownership of assets. Criminals may ask legal professionals to create \ncompanies and trusts and/or to manage companies and trusts, to provide greater \nrespectability and legitimacy to the entities and their activities. \nYour PWRA should consider the practice’s exposure to this type of work, and the risks \ninvolved– especially where the practice undertakes complex company or trust work for \nclients involving higher risk jurisdictions. This is particularly important where beneficial \nownership or nature of business can be obscured or anonymised, or the use of nominees or \nbearer shares is permitted. \n \nShell companies are corporate entities that do not have any business activities or assets. \nThey may be used for legitimate purposes such as serving as a temporary transaction \nvehicle. However, they can also be an easy and inexpensive way to disguise beneficial \nownership and the flow of illegitimate funds and so are attractive to criminals engaged in \nmoney laundering. You should consider it as high risk if a client engages your services only \nin connection with the routine aspects of forming an entity, without seeking further legal \nadvice on the appropriateness of the corporate structure and related matters. In jurisdictions \nwhere members of the public may register companies themselves with the company registry, \n\n \n \nthe engagement of a legal professional to register the company (or to use the practice’s \naddress) may indicate that the client is seeking to add the appearance of legitimacy to a \ncompany. \n \n5.6.3.4 Other Services \n \nOther services to consider in risk assessments are: \n• Services where legal professionals may represent or assure the client’s standing, \nreputation and credibility to third parties, without a commensurate knowledge of the \nclient’s affairs; \n• Acquisitions of businesses in liquidation; and \n• Services offered to clients in the context of trade based or trade-finance \narrangements. \n5.6.3.5 Risk of offering both in-scope and out-of-scope services \n \nMany practices have both an AML-compliant client onboarding (take-on) process and a \nseparate process for those areas of activity outside the scope of the Regulations. This is \npermissible, but it does create a risk. \n \nThe risk is that if a client is onboarded via an AML non-compliant process for out-of-scope \nwork, and then transferred over to AML in-scope services, there is likely to be a need to \napply further due diligence, in order to bring the original due diligence up to the required \nstandard. \n \nTo mitigate this risk practices may either have clear and robust PCPs in place to manage \nthe transition or conduct full AML-compliant CDD regardless of the nature of the matter. \nThis would enable a client to be transferred more easily between a practice’s out-of-scope \nand in-scope services. \n \n5.6.3.6 Dealing with payments credited to your client account without permission \n \nLegal professionals may receive funds that are either overpayments, or completely \nunasked for deposits. You should give consideration to the possibility that any unsolicited \npayment or unexpected overpayment may have been engineered for the purposes of \nmoney laundering and treat these instances appropriately (including consideration of the \nsubmission of a SAR as appropriate). A repayment of funds from a legal professional’s \naccount may help to legitimise the proceeds of crime. \n \nSuch instances should be recorded in an appropriate place, for example in a client or \nmatter risk assessment, or in the records of the MLRO. \n \nOne way to deal with such matters is to set an internal value threshold, beyond which, \ngreater consideration must be given to whether the circumstances prompt suspicion and a \nsubsequent disclosure to the NCA. Except in exceptional circumstances funds received in \nsuch a manner should only be returned to the source from which they were received.   \n \n\n \n \nR31(2) confirms that you are not prevented from repaying money deposited in your client \naccount, provided that, if you have suspicion of money laundering, you obtain \nconsent/DAML from NCA for the transaction. \n \nIf you display your client account details freely, for example, on your letterhead or a \nwebsite, the risk of them being abused by criminals is greatly increased. This is something \nyou should avoid.",

A question to ask yourself in this context and more generally is: “do \nthe services I am being asked to provide make sense given what I know about the client?” \n \nR5(1) defines the beneficial owner of a body corporate, other than a listed company, as \nmeaning: \n \nany individual who: \n \n• exercises ultimate control over the management of the body corporate; \n• ultimately owns or controls, directly or indirectly, including through bearer share \nholdings or other means, more than 25% of the shares or voting rights in the body \ncorporate; \n• otherwise controls the body: \no by satisfying one or more of the conditions set out in Part 1 of \nSchedule 1A to the Companies Act 2006 (persons with significant \ncontrol); or \no if the individual were an undertaking, the body corporate would be a \nsubsidiary undertaking of the individual under section1162 of the \nCompanies Act 2006 read with Part 7 of that Act. \n \nThis does not apply to a company listed on a regulated market. It does apply to UK \nlimited liability partnerships. \n \nRegulation 6(1) In relation to a trust, the Regulations define the beneficial owner as each of:  \n• the settlor;  \n• the trustees;  \n• the beneficiaries, or where the individuals benefiting from the trust have not been \ndetermined,  the  class  of  persons  in  whose  main  interest  the  trust  is  set  up,  or \noperates; and \n• any individual who has control over the trust.  \nIn relation to a foundation or other legal arrangement similar to a trust, the beneficial owners \nare  those  who  hold  equivalent  or  similar  positions  to  those  set  out  above  in  the  case  of \ntrusts. \n \nIn  relation  to  a  legal  entity  or  legal  arrangement  which  does  not  fall  into  the  above,  the \nbeneficial owners are:  \n• any individual who benefits from the property of the entity or arrangement;  \n\n \n \n• where the  individuals  who  benefit from  the  entity or  arrangement  have  yet  to  be \nidentified, the class of persons in whose main interest the entity or arrangement is \nset up or operates; and \n• any individual who exercises control over the property of the entity or arrangement. \nUnincorporated associations and foundations are examples of entities and \narrangements likely to fall within these requirements. \n \nWhen applying this, relevant points to consider are: \n \n• the property of the entity includes its capital and its profits; \n• determined benefits are those to which an individual is currently entitled; \n• contingent benefits or situations where no determination has been made \nshould be dealt with as a class to which (and because) benefit has yet to be \ndetermined; \n• a class of persons need only be identified by description; \n• an  entity  or  arrangement  is  set  up  for,  or  operates  in,  the  main  interest  of  the \npersons who are likely to get most of the property; \n• control includes the ability to manage the use of funds or transactions outside the \nnormal management structure and control mechanisms; and \n• where you find a body corporate with the requisite interest outlined above, you will \nneed to make further proportionate enquiries as to the beneficial owner of the \nbody corporate. \n \n6.15.2 Other forms of control \n \nYou should be alert to the risk that a corporate entity can also be subject to control by \npersons other than shareholders. Such control may rest with those who have power to \nmanage funds or transactions without requiring specific authority to do so, and who would \nbe in a position to authorise changes to internal procedures and control mechanisms. \nDepending on the control structures in an entity, this could be a senior role operating \nwithout actual or effective supervision or another entity. \n \nYou should remain alert to any person or entity with such powers while you are obtaining \nan understanding of the ownership and control structure of the corporate entity and make \nsuch further enquiries you need in order to understand the control structure. Monitor \nsituations within the retainer where control structures appear to be bypassed or unduly \ncomplex on a risk sensitive basis. \n \n6.16 CDD on a beneficial owner \n \n6.16.1 General Comments  \n \nBeneficial Owners must be identified, and reasonable measures must be taken to verify \ntheir identities so that you are satisfied you know who the beneficial owner is and that they \nare in fact the beneficial owner in question.  \n \nIn complex structures, practices may have to look through layers of ownership (and \nconsider any associated dilution of that ownership) to arrive at any natural persons owning \nor controlling the client entity.  \n\n \n \n \nIt is important to review both shareholdings and voting rights in respect of beneficial \nownership, along with understanding the class and value of shares any individual holds. \n \nWhere the shareholding of an entity indicates that no one owns or controls over 25% of a \nclient you may wish to consider whether it is appropriate that the senior manager (e.g., \nCEO, board, controlling mind of the company) be considered as the beneficial owners \nunder R5(1))(a) and (c). This is subtly different to the requirements of R28(8) and would \nnot necessarily raise a concern of extra risks as the circumstances of R28(7) might. \n \nWhen conducting CDD on a client, you will need to identify any beneficial owners as \ndefined above. This may be undertaken by obtaining: \n \n• shareholder details from a reputable online registry or commercial provider; \n• a copy of a detailed structure chart; and \n• a copy of the trust deed, partnership agreement or other such document. \n \nIt is not enough to solely rely on the information contained in a company’s register of \npersons with significant control. You should consider what is the appropriate level of \nverification required on an RBA. \n \nThese reasonable measures to verify a beneficial owner, may differ to those you may use \nto verify the identity of a client that is a natural person. For example, you may not require \npassports or driving licenses in these circumstances, but EID&V may present an effective \nway to verify the identities of beneficial owners.   \n \nIt is for your practice to determine a tailored and risk sensitive approach that is appropriate \nto ensure you are satisfied you know who a beneficial owner is and that you fully \nunderstand their relationship with the non-natural person. \n6.16.2 Requirements introduced in 2020 \n \nIf you cannot identify the beneficial owner (where they have more than 25% holding of the \ncompany), you should consider whether this makes the client or matter higher risk and treat \nit accordingly and consider whether you should continue to act for the client. \n \nIf you cannot identify a beneficial owner pursuant to the above despite having exhausted all \npossible means of doing so or if you are not satisfied that the person is the beneficial owner, \nyou must then take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the senior responsible \nmanager of the body corporate. Depending on the circumstances, it may be that you have \nalready concluded this is the case on the basis that the individual “exercises ultimate control \nover the management of the body corporate” under Regulation 5(1)(a), although you should \nnote that the scope of Regulation 5(1)(a) is not limited to this scenario. \nIn practice, this may be the Chief Executive Officer or President of the group, or someone \nelse in the executive team with high level responsibility for the running of the relevant aspect \nof the body corporate. \n \nYou must also record: \n• All the actions you have undertaken to this end; and \n• Any difficulties encountered. \n\n \n \n \n6.16.3 Agency \n \nR6(9) says a beneficial owner generally means any individual who ultimately owns or \ncontrols the client or on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. \n \nIn most cases, it is presumed that the client is acting on their own behalf, unless the \nfeatures of the transaction indicate that they are acting on someone else's behalf.  As \nhighlighted above you should make enquiries when it appears the client may be acting on \nbehalf of someone else. \n \nSituations where a natural person may be acting on behalf of someone else include: \n \n• exercising a power of attorney - the document granting power of attorney may be \nsufficient to verify the beneficial owner's identity; \n• acting  as  the  deputy,  administrator  or  insolvency  practitioner - appointment \ndocuments may be sufficient to verify the beneficial owner's identity; or \n• acting as an appointed broker or other agent to conduct a transaction - signed \nletter of appointment may be sufficient to verify the beneficial owner's identity. \n \nYou should be alert to the possibility that purported agency relationships are actually \nbeing utilised to facilitate a fraud, leading to possible encounters with the proceeds of \ncrime. Understanding the reason for the agency, rather than simply accepting \ndocumentary evidence of such at face value, will assist to mitigate this risk. Where a \nclient or retainer is higher risk, you should obtain further verification of the beneficial \nowner's identity in line with the suggested CDD methods to be applied to natural persons. \n \nThis may also include where a legal practice commissions your services on behalf of \nsomeone else.  \n \n6.16.4 Companies \n \n6.16.4.1 A proportionate approach \n \nWhere you have adequately assessed ML risk to be lower, it would not be generally \nproportionate to conduct independent searches across multiple entities at multiple layers \nof a corporate chain to see whether, by accumulating very small interests in different \nentities, a person finally achieves more than a 25 per cent interest in the client corporate \nentity. Nevertheless, you must be satisfied that you have an overall understanding of the \nownership and control structure of the client company. This provision does not apply in \nany situations of higher risk, where EDD should be applied. \n \n6.16.4.2 Companies with capital in the form of bearer shares \n \nA bearer share is a form of equity (i.e., a stock or share in a company or equivalent) wholly \nowned by whoever holds the physical stock certificate. Given this, there is no way to \nregister the owner of the stock confidently or consistently nor track transfers of ownership \n \n\n \n \nThese pose a much higher risk of money laundering as it is often difficult to identify \nbeneficial owners and such companies are often incorporated in jurisdictions with lower \nAML/CTF regulations. You should consider whether the risk posed is acceptable for your \npractice before proceeding.  \n \nIf you do proceed, you must adopt procedures to establish the identities of the holders and \nmaterial beneficial owners of such shares and ensure you are notified whenever there is a \nchange of holder and/or beneficial owner (i.e., who they are held on behalf of).  \n \nThis might be achieved by: \n \n• requiring that the shares be deposited with you or a regulated person with whom \nyou have a binding covenant; or  \n• getting appropriate assurance that either such a regulated person or the holder \nof the shares will notify you of any change of records/holder/ownership relating \nto the shares. \n \nUltimately it is for your practice to determine the confidence you can place in any assurances \nthat the bearer shares will not be used to hide money laundering or terrorist financing, \nhowever extreme caution must be exercised. Bear in mind that the issuance of bearer \nshares has been banned in the UK since May 2015, primarily due to money laundering and \ntransparency concerns. Enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring should be \nperformed and practices must be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of controls in place \nto their supervisor. \n \nWhere a practice does undertake work for clients where beneficial ownership is held in the \nform of bearer shares, this should be articulated in the Practice-Wide Risk Assessment. \n \n6.16.5 Trusts \nWhenever you are instructed by someone involved with an existing trust to advise in relation \nto it, you must extend your CDD to the trust’s beneficial owners.  \n \nYou should take a risk-based approach to verifying the identity of the ultimate beneficial \nowner/s of a professional trustee entity (as they should have no interest in the assets placed \nin trust). Higher-risk indicators may be where the professional trustee entity is unregulated or \nwhere the professional trustee is not independent of the settlor (e.g., family offices). Where \nsuch factors are present, reasonable measures should be taken to verify the identity of the \nbeneficial owner/s of the trustee. Lower risk factors may be where the professional trustee is \nitself a regulated entity (or owned by one) or is large, well-known and/or listed on a regulated \nmarket. In such low-risk instances, you should not need to identify and verify beneficial \nownership of the professional trustee, although you should document the rationale for your \nactions. \n \nR28(4)(a) requires a relevant person to identify the beneficial owner ‘of a client’ which is \nbeneficially owned by another person. R6(1) defines ‘the beneficial owners in relation to a \ntrust’ as the settlor, the trustees, the beneficiaries (or class of beneficiaries) and any \nindividual who has control over the trust. Although your client will not actually be the trust \n(because a trust does not have legal personality), if you advise any client in relation to a \ntrust, the Regulations require you to understand who the trust's other beneficial owners are, \nas defined in R6(1).",

    "content": "6.14.11 Companies – General Requirements \n \nYou must identify and verify \n• the name of the company; \n• its company number or other registration number; and \n• the address of its registered office, and if different, its principal place of business. \n \nFurthermore, the practice must take reasonable measures to determine and verify the law to \nwhich the company is subject, and its constitution (whether set out in its articles of association \nor other governing documents) and the full names of the board of directors (or if there is no \nboard, the members of the equivalent management body) and the senior persons responsible \nfor the operations of the body corporate.  \nA practice must collect proof of registration (e.g., via the client) or an excerpt from the \nrelevant register before establishing a business relationship with a:  \n• UK company (registered or unregistered as defined in the Unregistered Companies \nRegulations 2009(1)); \n\n \n \n• UK Limited Liability Partnership; or  \n• Scottish Partnership. \nYou must collect proof of registration (e.g., via the client) or an excerpt from the relevant \nregister.  \n \nDiscrepancies in this information must be reported to the registrar, see Section 12 for more \ndetails. \nWhere the client is beneficially owned by another person, the practice must also: \n• identify the beneficial owner; and \n• take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner, along with the \nownership and control structure of the non-natural person R28(4)(c). \nThese reasonable measures for verifying the identity of a non-natural person, may be \neasier to undertake for smaller entities where the beneficial owners may be more \naccessible. For larger entities where the beneficial owners may be more difficult to contact \ndirectly, EID&V may be of significant help when verifying their identities. \n \nWhere a company is well-known or regulated for AML to a standard equivalent to which \nyou are subject to in the UK you may consider that the level of money laundering and \nterrorist financing risks are low and apply CDD on a risk-based approach. For listed \ncompanies see below. \n \nWhere you commence acting for a wholly owned subsidiary of an existing client, you may \nrefer to the CDD file for your existing client for verification of details of the subsidiary, \nprovided that the existing client has been identified to the standards of the Regulations or \nto a similar standard in another jurisdiction. \n \n6.14.11.1 Public companies listed on Regulated Markets \n \nYou must obtain and verify the: \n \n• company name; \n• company number or other registration number; and \n• address of the registered office and, if different, principal place of business. \n \nIn accordance with R28(5), if the company is listed on a regulated market it is not \nnecessary to: \n \n• obtain information about the beneficial owners of the company; or \n• take  reasonable  measures  to  determine  and  verify  the  law  to  which  it  is \nsubject or the names of its directors and senior persons. \n \nThis may also be applied to a majority-owned subsidiary of such a company \nwhere you have established the nature of ownership via an independent and \nreliable source. \n \nFor a wholly owned subsidiary of a listed company, you will also require \nevidence of the parent/subsidiary relationship. Such evidence may be: \n \n• the subsidiary's last filed annual return/confirmation; \n\n \n \n• a note in the parent's or subsidiary's last audited accounts or annual report; \n• information  from  a reputable  electronic  verification  service  provider  or  online \nregistry; or \n• information from the parent company’s published reports, for example, from their \nwebsite. \n \n“Regulated market” is defined as follows: \n• Within  the  EEA,  the  meaning  given  by  Article  4.1  (14)  of  the  Markets  in \nFinancial Instruments Directive; and \n• Outside the EEA, a regulated financial market which subjects’ companies \nwhose securities are admitted to trading to disclosure obligations which are \nequivalent to the specified disclosure obligations. \n \n“specified disclosure obligations” means— \n \n(a)disclosure obligations set out in Articles 17 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 \nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16th April 2014 on market abuse \n(22); \n(b)disclosure obligations consistent with Articles 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14 and 16 of Directive \n2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4th November 2003 on \nthe prospectuses to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted \nto trading(23); \n(c)disclosure obligations consistent with Articles 4 to 6, 14, 16 to 19 and 30 of \nDirective 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15th \nDecember 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to \ninformation about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated \nmarket(24); and \n(d)disclosure requirements consistent with EU legislation made under the provisions \nmentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c); \n \n \nIf a regulated market is located within the EEA there is no requirement to undertake \nchecks on the market itself. Under a risk-based approach you may wish to simply record \nthe steps taken to ascertain the status of the market. \n \nConsider a similar approach for non-EEA markets that subject companies to disclosure \nobligations which are contained in international standards equivalent to specified \ndisclosure obligations in the EU. Jurisdictional AML risks should also be considered – \nsee the risk assessment section of this guidance for further information. \n \nConsult the register on the European Securities and Markets Authority website. \nFollowing an assessment that the client is low risk it will be sufficient, for a listed \ncompany, to obtain confirmation of the company's listing on the regulated market.  \n \nSuch evidence may be: \n \n• a copy of the dated page of the website of the relevant stock exchange \nshowing the listing; \n• a photocopy of the listing in a reputable newspaper; or \n• information  from  a  reputable  electronic  verification  service  provider  or  online \nregistry. \n \n\n \n \nWhere a listed company is owned by multiple parties that are themselves held on a \nregulated market(s), this does not need to be treated differently to a listed company that \nis a wholly owned subsidiary of one, except that you need to collect the details of all \nowners as above. \n \nWhen assessing a listed company’s relationship with a market, you should have regard to \nwhether a company’s ownership is only partially available on a market i.e., only a \npercentage is publicly held. In this context, you should consider seeking further \ninformation about any owners whose relationship is not through a regulated market on a \nrisk sensitive basis. In other words, a company having any proportion of a listing on a \nregulated market however small, does not mean you do not need to check other owners. \n \nThe regulated market in the UK is the London Stock Exchange. You may consider whether \nit is appropriate to treat companies listed on other markets in the same way as those \nmeeting the definition of “regulated markets” on a risk sensitive basis. For example, AIM is \nnot a ‘regulated market’, but you may consider, on a risk-based approach, treating it as \nsuch. \n \nWhere further CDD is required for a listed company (i.e., when it is not on a regulated \nmarket or where you otherwise deem it necessary) consider the nature of the risks \npresented and obtain additional information/comforts to address those risks.  This may \ninclude obtaining relevant information or particulars of the company's identity or business \npractices. \n \nVerification sources may include: \n \n• a search of the relevant company registry (such as Companies House); \n• a copy of the company's certificate of incorporation; \n• a copy of their audited accounts; or \n• information from a reputable electronic verification service provider. \n \nYou are still required to conduct ongoing monitoring of the business relationship with a publicly \nlisted company to enable you to spot suspicious activity. \n \nCompanies whose listing does not fall within the above requirements should be identified in \naccordance with the provisions for private companies. \n \n6.14.11.2 Private and unlisted companies in the UK \n \nPrivate companies are generally subject to a lower level of public disclosure than \npublic companies. In general, however, the structure, ownership, purposes and \nactivities of many private companies will be clear and understandable. \n \nSources for verifying corporate identification may include: \n \n• certificate of incorporation; \n• articles of association (or equivalent formation documents); \n• details from the relevant company registry, confirming details of the company and \nof the director/s and their addresses; \n• filed audited accounts; or \n• information from a reputable electronic verification service provider. \n\n \n \n \nR43 requires UK companies not listed on a regulated market to provide information \nabout their identity on request, including their articles of association or other governing \ndocuments and information about beneficial owners. \n \n6.14.11.3 Private and unlisted overseas companies \n \nObtaining CDD material for these companies may be more difficult, particularly \nregarding beneficial ownership where ownership is held in jurisdictions where no \npublicly available corporate registers are available, or ownership can be otherwise \nconcealed through the use of nominees. If this is the case, it should be taken as an \nincreased risk factor and may warrant the application of enhanced due diligence \nmeasures. \n \nThe company's identity should be established in the same way as for UK private and \nunlisted companies. \nWhere you are not obtaining original documentation, you should consider the need for \nfurther comfort on authenticity on a risk-based approach. Certification of documents does \nnot automatically guarantee documentation is genuine.  \n \n6.14.11.4 The Register of Overseas Entities \n \nOverseas entities wishing to buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK must now \nregister with Companies House. An overseas entity is defined as a legal entity governed \nby the law of a country or territory outside the UK. \n \nThis requirement applies to overseas entities who own real property in the UK and have \ndone so since:  \n \n• in England and Wales, on or since 1 January 1999 \n• in Scotland, on or since 8 December 2014 \n• in Northern Ireland, on or since 5 September 2022. \nRegulation 28(9) does not exclude the ROE as a register on which you can rely on for the \npurposes of verification under 28(4). Nonetheless, it is important not to rely solely on this or \nany other register. Regulation 30A, for example, introduced a discrepancy reporting \nrequirement for the ROE which indicates that inconsistency may occur. The information \nprovided by such registers should be verified independently. \nEntries on the Register of Overseas Interests are not public but copies may be obtained on \napplication to Companies House. \nMore information is available here.",

    "content": "6.14 Methods of verification \n \nVerification should be completed on the basis of documents or information which come \nfrom a reliable source, independent of the client. There are a number of ways in which you \nmay verify a client's identity including: \n \n• obtaining or viewing original documents from a trusted and independent source \n(public or private); \n• on a risk sensitive basis viewing copies of documents (certification of a copy may \ngive you a higher level of confidence than an uncertified copy, but you should \nconsider and document the risks of relying on certified copies for this);  \n• conducting electronic verification, through a platform that is a reliable source (i.e., \nsecure from fraud and misuse and capable of providing an appropriate level of \nassurance that the person claiming a particular identity is in fact the person with \nthat identity, to a degree that is necessary for effectively managing and mitigating \nany risks of money laundering and terrorist financing); or \n• obtaining information from other regulated persons. \n \n6.14.1 Independent sources \n \nYou need a reliable source(s) to verify your client’s identity, which is independent of the \nclient e.g.  a passport or driver’s license, or, in the case of a corporate entity, evidence of \nregistration from the relevant registry or reputable company services provider. \n \nYou are permitted to use a wider range of sources when verifying the identity of the \nbeneficial owner and understanding the ownership and control structure of the client.  \n \nSometimes only the client or their representatives will be able to provide you with this \ninformation. You may consider whether the documents or information should be certified as \naccurate by a professional regulated for AML to an equivalent standard.  \n \nR28(9) confirms that the register of people with significant control, or the confirmation \nstatement, which is published on the Companies House website, cannot be solely relied \nupon for the purpose of identifying or verifying the identity of the beneficial owner of a \ncompany or LLP client.  \n \nThe Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA) brought in a \nnumber of changes to the way that companies are registered and what information must \nbe declared on an ongoing basis. These increase the volume and detail required on \nregistration and in annual returns. While this information will be very useful in assessing \nrisk and completing due diligence, R28(9) is not affected.  \n \nRemember, if you are not satisfied with the information you have on the identity of your \nclient/beneficial owner, you should not undertake business with that client, (or cease \nbusiness if an existing client) as per the requirements of R31. \n \nDocuments should be in date if an expiry date is given, and recently dated (taking a risk-\nbased approach) if no expiry date is given. Expired documents should not be relied upon \nin the absence of any others but may be useful in support. \n \n\n \n \n6.14.2 Forged Documents \n \nYou must not ignore obvious forgeries, but you are not required to be an expert in forged \ndocuments. You may however consider providing relevant employees with appropriate \ntraining and equipment to help identify forged documents where relevant to the processes \nof your practice where proportionate to the risk. \n \nYou may make use of guidance on how to identify a forged document from the issuing \nbody, or a similarly reputable source. For example, the Passport office issues such \ninformation, and current bill formats are available on utility provider websites.  \n \n6.14.3 Electronic verification \n \nAs technology has developed, use of electronic identification and verification (EID&V) tools \nhave become more common. While you can never outsource your ultimate responsibility, \nEID&V tools can be useful in protecting your practice. \n \nR28 sets out minimum requirements for EID&V processes to be regarded as reliable sources \nin applying CDD.  \n \nTest for whether you are able to use an EID&V tool \n \nMeeting the definitions in the (R2014/910/EU of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council of 23rd July 2014) as below \n \nElectronic identification - means the process of using person identification data in \nelectronic form uniquely representing either a natural or legal person, or a natural \nperson representing a legal person \n \nTrust service - means an electronic service normally provided for remuneration \nwhich consists of: \n(a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals \nor electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates \nrelated to those services; \n(b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; \nor \n(c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those \nservices \n \n-and being secure from fraud, misuse and capable of providing an appropriate level \nof assurance that the person claiming a particular identity is in fact the person with \nthat identity, to a degree that is necessary for effectively managing and mitigating \nany risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. \n \n \nThere is further information available on this in Section 7. \n \n\n \n \n6.14.4 Natural persons \nThe name, date of birth and current address of a natural person should all be identified \nand practices may use government photo-card identification (including passports or driving \nlicenses) to verify these details. \n \nTo do this you should obtain documents that verify name, address and date of birth, for \nexample:  \n \n• one government document which verifies name, address  and date of birth; or \n• a government document which verifies the client's full name and supporting \ndocuments which verifies their address and date of birth. \n \nYou may consult a variety of documents to identify and verify your client. Where \ngovernment-issued documents are not available, you may consider alternatives such as \nthose set out at 6.14.7 below.   \nThe requirement to obtain suitable verification should not preclude access to legal services, \nespecially to vulnerable, elderly or disadvantaged clients. In these situations, where it is not \npossible to obtain such documents, consider the reliability of other sources and the risks \nassociated with the client and the matter. See the “Clients unable to produce standard \ndocumentation” section below. \n \nWhere you are reasonably satisfied that an individual is nationally or internationally \nknown, for example, because they are a public figure or a well-known celebrity (i.e., that \nyou can confidently recognise them as the person they are purporting to be), a record of \nidentification may include a file note of your satisfaction about identity, including an \naddress. You should consider whether the individual may be a PEP, or family member \nor known close associate of a PEP.",

In the UK, you may come across five types of \ncharities: \n \n• small; \n• registered; \n• unregistered; \n• excepted, such as churches; or \n• exempt, such as museums and universities. \n \nFor registered charities, you should take a record of their full name, registration number \nand place of business. Details of registered charities in the UK can be obtained from: \n \n• the Charity Commission of England and Wales; \n• the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator; or \n• the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland. \n \nOther countries may also have charity regulators which maintain a list of registered \ncharities. You may consider it appropriate to refer to these when verifying the identity of \nan overseas charity. \n \nFor all other types of charities, you should consider the business structure of the charity \nand apply CDD appropriately. You may also get confirmation of UK charitable status from \nHMRC. Further, in applying the risk-based approach to charities it is worth considering \nwhether it is a well-known entity or not. The more obscure the charity, the more likely you \nare to want to view the constitutional documents of the charity, along with any other \ndocuments that may clarify the individuals in control and its status. \n \n\n \n \nDue to the numerous examples of charities and not-for-profit organisations as fund raising \nvehicles for terrorist organisations you may want to also consult HM Treasury's \nconsolidated list of persons designated as being subject to financial restrictions to ensure \nthe charity is not a designated person. \n \nAnother point to consider is Source of Funds, in that charities may fund transactions \neffectively through crowdfunding, which can make a Source of Funds check difficult to \ncomplete. Taking a risk-based approach you should consider whether you need to seek \ninformation as to who those individuals or entities are that are funding the charity, \nparticularly those contributing larger percentages or amounts. \n6.14.16 Deceased persons' estates \n \nWhen acting for the executor(s) or administrators of an estate, you should establish their \nidentity using the procedures for natural persons or companies set out above. When \nacting for more than one executor or administrator, you should verify the identity of at \nleast two of them. You should also get copies of the death certificate, grant of probate \nand any letters of administration. \n \nIf a will trust is created, and the trustees are different from the executors, the procedures \nin relation to trusts will need to be followed when the will trust comes into operation. \n \n6.14.17 Churches and places of worship \n \nPlaces of worship may either register as a charity or can apply for registration as a certified \nbuilding of worship from the General Register Office (GRO) which will issue a certificate. \nFurther, their charitable tax status will be registered with HMRC. As such, identification \ndetails with respect to the church or place of worship may be verified: \n \n• as for a charity; \n• through the headquarters or regional organisation of the denomination or \nreligion; \n• with reference to the GRO certificate; or \n• through an enquiry to HMRC. \n \n6.14.18 Schools and colleges \n \nSchools and colleges may be a registered charity, a private company, an \nunincorporated association or a government entity and should be verified in \naccordance with the relevant category. The Department of Education maintains \nlists of approved educational establishments which may assist in verifying the \nexistence of the school or college. \n \n6.14.19 Clubs and associations \n \nMany of these bear a low money laundering risk, but this depends on the scope of \ntheir purposes, ownership structure, activities and geographic spread. \n\n \n \n \nThe following information may be relevant to the identity of the club or association: \n \n• full name; \n• legal status; \n• purpose; \n• any registered address; or \n• names of all office holders. \n \nDocuments which may verify the existence of the club or association include: \n \n• any articles of association or constitution; \n• statement from a bank, building society or credit union; \n• recent audited accounts; or \n• financial statements presented to the annual general meeting. \n \n6.14.20 Government agencies and councils \n \nThe money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with public authorities vary \nsignificantly depending on the nature of the retainer and the home jurisdiction of the public \nauthority. It may be simple to establish that the entity exists, but where there is a \nheightened risk of corruption or misappropriation of government monies, greater monitoring \nof retainers should be applied. \n \nThe following information may be relevant when establishing a public sector entity's \nidentity: \n \n• full name of the entity; \n• nature and status of the entity; \n• address of the entity; \n• name of the home state authority; \n• name of the directors or equivalent; \n• name of the individual instructing you and confirmation of their authority to do so; \nor \n• extract from official government website. \n \nUnder R37(3) the fact that the client is a public administration or publicly owned enterprise \nis one of the factors to consider when deciding whether it is low risk and whether to apply \nsimplified due diligence. It will usually be appropriate to apply simplified due diligence to \nUK public authorities and to some non-UK public authorities, particularly those in the EEA. \n \n6.14.21 Further Information \n \nYou may wish to consider the UK Financial Services Joint Money Laundering \nSteering Group (JMLSG) guidance Part 1 – (available here) as a useful source of \ninformation on possible ways to apply CDD on the above entities, and across a \nbroader range of other entity structures. You should note though that in the context of \nlegal services, the LSAG guidance takes precedent.",

    "content": "# LSAG AML Guidance 2025 - Customer Due Diligence (CDD)\n# Sections 6.1 - 6.16\n# Source: lsag-aml-guidance-23-april-2025.pdf\n\n6.1 General Comments  \n \nUndertaking appropriate Client Due Diligence (CDD) is required under R27, and is one of the \nkey controls you have, to protect your practice from Money Laundering and Terrorism \nFinancing (ML/TF) risks. \n \nCDD is the collective term for the checks you must do on your clients, which may differ \ndepending on the circumstances. It is holistic in nature and is wider than simply \nundertaking identification and verification of clients. \n \nAside from any specific CDD requirements you must take under the Regulations, the \namount, type and level of CDD undertaken should reflect and mitigate the nature of \nparticular risks inherent in each client, transaction or matter.  \n \n\n \n \nPractices must be able to demonstrate to their supervisory authority that these CDD \nmeasures are appropriate in mitigation of these risks, by recording their reasoning and \nactions in this regard. \n \nUseful information in regard to understanding the nature and purpose of a relationship may \ninclude:  \n• The nature and details of the business/occupation/employment; \n• Source of funds and source of wealth information; or \n• Anticipated levels and nature of activity to be conducted. \nBeyond adherence to the Regulations, there is a natural incentive for practices to establish \nwith confidence who their client is and the details of any transaction they are involved in or \nfacilitating. It will protect them from unintentionally facilitating a range of financial crimes or \nbeing defrauded themselves. \n \nIdentifying and verifying clients, is also essential for a practice to be able to accurately report \nsuspicious activity to the National Crime Agency (NCA), identify Politically Exposed Persons \n(PEPs) or other high-risk individuals, and ensure the practice is not undertaking business in \nbreach of applicable sanctions regimes. \n \nIn relation to CDD, the Policies, Controls and Procedures (PCPs) of your firm should be set \nout clearly, in writing in a way that is accessible to all relevant staff in your practice. \n \n6.2 Long-standing/Personal Relationships \n \nThere is no provision in the Regulations for waiving CDD requirements on the basis of long-\nstanding or personal relationships. Taking this approach will not satisfy the requirement to \nundertake independent verification, though these factors may inform your risk-based \napproach. \n \n6.3 Application of CDD \n \nYou are required to apply CDD for services in scope of the Regulations when: \n \n• establishing a business relationship; \n• carrying out an occasional transaction that amounts to a transfer of funds within \nthe meaning of Article 3.9 of the Funds Transfer Regulation (Regulation (EU) \n2015/847)\n exceeding 1,000 Euros; \n \n(9) ‘transfer of funds’ means any transaction at least partially carried out by electronic means on behalf of a \npayer through a payment service provider, with a view to making funds available to a payee through a \npayment service provider, irrespective of whether the payer and the payee are the same person and \nirrespective of whether the payment service provider of the payer and that of the payee are one and the \nsame, including:  \n(a)  a credit transfer as defined in point (1) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012;  \n(b)  a direct debit as defined in point (2) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012;  \n(c)  a money remittance as defined in point (13) of Article 4 of Directive 2007/64/EC, whether national or cross \nborder;  \n(d)  a transfer carried out using a payment card, an electronic money instrument, or a mobile phone, or any \nother digital or IT prepaid or post-paid device with similar characteristics;   \n\n \n \n• carrying out an occasional transaction that amounts to 15,000 Euros or more, \nwhether it is executed in a single operation or in several operations which appear \nto be linked; \n• you suspect money laundering or terrorist financing; or \n• you doubt the veracity or adequacy of documents or information previously \nobtained for the purposes of identification or verification. \nThe Regulations as amended prescribe further situations where you must re-apply CDD for \nexisting clients. These arise when you have any legal duty in the course of the calendar year \nto contact a client to review information: \n \n• relevant to your client risk assessment (or practice-wide/matter risk assessment as \nappropriate); or \n• concerning beneficial ownership information of the customer, including information \nwhich helps you understand the ownership or control structure of any entity that is \nthe beneficial owner of the client. \n \nThe duty also arises where a practice has a duty to contact the client under the International \nTax Compliance Regulations 2015. \n \n6.4 Definition of Business Relationship \nThere may be several indicators that a client is establishing a business relationship, as \nopposed to the matter being an “occasional transaction” including but not limited to: \n• an explicit expectation from the client or practice that a business relationship is \nbeing established; \n• the nature of the client or the transaction suggests they may wish to undertake \nmore than one transaction e.g., it is in the nature of their business;  \n• or the transaction itself will inherently take time to complete e.g., the \nbuying/selling of real property. \n \nThe definition of business relationship under the Regulations requires the legal \npractitioner to have an expectation at the time the contact is established, that the \nrelationship will have “an element of duration” (R4). This should be interpreted in the \nbroadest sense, as it is reasonable to assume that any legal professional will have an \nexpectation of possible further business from any initial contact made with a client. \nWhen dealing with a client for the first time, you should assume that a business \nrelationship is being formed unless you have explicit reasons to know that this is not \nthe case i.e., that there will not be an “element of duration.”  \n \nThe nature of the relationship should be recorded in the client risk assessment. Any \nreasons for not applying CDD must be clearly recorded and this will in practice be in \nthe rarest of exceptions. \n \nFor the avoidance of doubt, any company formation on behalf of a client immediately \nimplies the establishment of a business relationship as per R4(2). \n \n6.5 Definition of an occasional transaction \n \nA transaction that falls outside of a “business relationship,” is known as an occasional \ntransaction. \n \n\n \n \nBy definition it can only apply where a practice-client relationship lacks an expectation \nof an “element of duration.” For this definition to apply, the relationship must be limited \nto a single service provided at a certain point in time.   \n \nIt will still be necessary to undertake CDD for an occasional transaction where it has a \nvalue of 15,000 Euros or more. 15,000 Euros relates only to the sums involved in the \ntransaction(s) and does not include legal fees or distributions. \n \nDue to the ongoing duties a practice would have in most foreseeable circumstances, \nthis definition is not likely to apply to the relationship between a legal practice and a \nclient for any transaction. \n \nIt may apply in the case of a limited ancillary service, provided as a one-off or in some \nexamples of notarial work in particular. Please see Part 2 for more information on \nnotarial work. \n \n6.6 Intermediaries, agents or representatives \n \nIf your client is represented by an intermediary, agent or representative (i.e., someone \npurporting to represent them), you must comply with R28(10) and identify and verify the \nintermediary's identity and their authority to act on behalf of your underlying client. \n \nExamples of someone purporting to represent might include: \n \n• a parent on behalf of an adult child; \n• an individual not employed by your client; or \n• a situation where the instructing persons authority to instruct is not clear or does not \nmake sense. \n \nIn the absence of factors that give rise to a concern, an employee of a company would \nnot be considered to be ‘purporting to instruct’.  A risk-based approach should be taken \nto the level of identification verification applied.  Authority to instruct can be addressed \nby an engagement letter or equivalent but it should come directly from the underlying \nclient (including where instructed by an employee of the company).  \n \nEven where someone does not purport to act on someone else’s behalf, you should \nconsider if it is possible there may be an underlying client that is the recipient \n(potentially by proxy via another professional service provider) of your services on more \nthan a single isolated basis. If you think this is possible, you should satisfy yourself that \nyou have identified and verified who the underlying client is or establish a suitable \nreliance arrangement with the professional you are dealing with. \n \nYou should ensure you understand who your client relationship is with. There may be \ntimes when an intermediary is your client (in that your contract is with them) but the \nintermediary’s client is the ultimate beneficiary of your work and advice. The regulations \nmake clear that a “beneficial owner” is the individual on whose behalf a transaction is \nbeing conducted and you should treat such a client as a beneficial owner, including \nundertaking reasonable measures to identify and verify their identity. This is different to \na situation where an entity refers a client to you (see below.) \n \nWhere the intermediary is an entity, you may consider whether you need to undertake \nUltimate Beneficial Ownership checks on a risk-based approach. \n\n \n \n \nSee 6.14.9 for how to identify and verify individuals in these situations. \n \n6.7 Referrals to another legal practice (or referrals between other entities in scope of \nthe regulations) \n \nThe difference between the circumstances described in 6.6 and making referrals to \nanother practice is described in the below table.  \n \nThis table relates to solicitors only - for arrangements relating to Barristers and \nAdvocates, please consult the relevant section in Part 2.  \nIntermediaries, Agents or \nRepresentatives \n \nReferrals \nIf you are instructed by a law firm, or \nother professional intermediary the law \nfirm/professional intermediary are your \nclient, and you will need to undertake \nCDD on them.  \n \nIf the effective beneficial owner of the \nadvice is that law firm’s/professional \nintermediary’s client, you should \nconsider the risks and identify/verify \ntheir client as you would any other \nultimate beneficial owner.  \nThis could include understanding the \nchecks the intermediary has carried \nout. \nWhere a legal practice or other \nintermediary refers a client to you and \nyou have the direct relationship with \nthe client, you should treat the referred \nentity as the client and carry out CDD \non them as the client in the usual way.  \nYou may wish to consider, having \nregard to the risks (and regulated \nstatus of the referring entity), whether \na reliance agreement with the referring \nentity is appropriate in the \ncircumstances. \n\n \n \n \n6.8 Timing of CDD \n \nCDD must be completed before you: \n• deliver substantive work or benefit; \n• permit funds to be deposited in your practice’s client account unless they are \nfor fees and disbursements;  \n• allow property to be transferred; or  \n• allow final agreements to be signed and completed. \nA legal practice should ensure that CDD has been completed as early as possible, before \nany money has been taken from the client, though money on account of costs/fees may be \naccepted on a risk sensitive basis. \n \nConducting CDD as early as possible also helps you to avoid any delays further along in the \nmatter and will help you in your duty to report suspicious activity, at an early stage. This can \nhelp protect you from needing to submit a suspicious activity report (SAR) seeking a defence \nagainst money laundering (DAML) to return funds that have been paid into your client \naccount, where you have a suspicion the funds may be the proceeds of crime. \n \nR30 requires you to verify your client's identity, the identity of any person purporting to act \non their behalf and that of any beneficial owner before you establish a business \nrelationship or carry out a transaction which amounts to 15,000 Euros or more (subject to \nR30(3)(a)). \n \n \n6.9 What happens when you cannot complete CDD? \n \nR31 provides that if you are unable to complete CDD in time, including identification & \nverification, you must: \n• not carry out a transaction with or for the client through a bank account; \n• not carry out a transaction otherwise than through a bank account; or, \n• terminate the business relationship. \n \nFor the avoidance of doubt, you should consider a failure to apply CDD under R28(10) \n(persons acting as agents) as also triggering the above requirements in R31. \n \nIf you are unable to complete CDD, you must in addition to terminating any existing business \nrelationship consider making a disclosure to the NCA. \n \nYou cannot seek consent from the NCA to proceed with a transaction solely because you \nhave been unable to complete CDD measures as required by R28 and reporting a matter \nto the NCA is not a substitute for your responsibility to complete CDD. Although you should \nconsider making a disclosure to the NCA where you have been unable to complete CDD, \nthis does not mean you are automatically required to submit a SAR. For further information \nrefer to Section 11. \n\n \n \n \n6.10 Exceptions to the timing requirement \nThere are exceptions to the timing requirement and the prohibition on acting for the client \nuntil CDD has been completed. \n \nWhere there is a delay in completing CDD you should consider why, and whether this \ngives rise to a suspicion which should be disclosed to the NCA. \n \nA practice should document any occasion where CDD was delayed in the matter risk \nassessment and take appropriate mitigatory steps in order to manage any risks this may \ncreate.  \n \nIn the event that you think either of the below exceptions apply, you should consider and \nrecord your reasoning as to why. \n \nHowever, when acting for a: \n \n• UK company (registered or unregistered as defined in the Unregistered \nCompanies Regulations 2009(1)); \n• UK Limited Liability Partnership; or  \n• Scottish Partnership \n \n- you must collect proof of registration (e.g., via the client) or an excerpt from the relevant \nregister before commencing a business relationship even when relying on an exception to \nthe timing requirement. \n \n6.10.1 Exception 1 - Normal conduct of business \nR30(3) provides that verification of the client and the beneficial owner may be completed as \nsoon as practicable after contact is first established, during the establishment of the \nbusiness relationship if: \n \n• it is necessary not to interrupt the normal conduct of business; and \n• there is little risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.  \n \nThis should be considered in the context of the points in 6.8 of this guidance. \n \nIf there is little risk of money laundering (due to the nature of the client or transaction) thus \nallowing a delay in CDD completion, the reasons for this view must be included in the \nclient and/or matter risk assessment, along with any mitigations you have put in place for \nthis. \n \nConsider your Practice Wide Risk Assessment (PWRA) when assessing which work, if \nany, can be undertaken prior to verification being completed. This exception does not \napply if your matter is an occasional transaction. \n \n \n\n \n \n6.10.2 Exception 2 - Ascertaining legal position \n \nR31(3) provides that the prohibitions in 31(1) do not apply where: \n’An independent legal professional or other professional adviser is in the course of \nascertaining the legal position for their client or performing the task of defending or \nrepresenting that client in, or concerning, legal proceedings, including giving advice on the \ninstitution or avoidance of proceedings.' \n \nWe interpret this to mean that this exception does not generally apply to transactional \nwork but may be relevant when considering work undertaken as a tax adviser or when \nascertaining the legal position an anticipation or preparation of early stages of \ntransactional work or early stages of representation or provision of legal advice on other \ntopics.  \n \n6.11 Undertaking CDD on Clients \n \nR28 requires that you must: \n \n• Identify the client and verify their identity on the basis of documents (e.g., passport \nor driver’s license) or information obtained from a reliable source which is \nindependent of the client (which may include a digital verification system, subject to \nmeeting certain criteria – further details provided under Section 7), unless the \nidentity of the client is already known to you and has been verified by you; \n• Identify where there is a beneficial owner who is not the client and take \nreasonable measures to verify the identity so that you are satisfied that you \nknow who the beneficial owner is; \n• Take reasonable measures to understand the ownership and control structure of \nthe legal person, trust, company, foundation or other similar legal arrangement; \n• Assess, and where appropriate obtain information on the purpose and intended \nnature of the business relationship or occasional transaction; and \n• Conduct ongoing monitoring, scrutinise transactions and make sure CDD \ndocuments are up to date. \n \n6.12 Identification and verification \n \nIdentification  of  a  client or  a  beneficial  owner  is simply  being told  or  otherwise  coming  to \nknow a client's identifying details, such as their name and address. \n \nVerification is obtaining evidence which supports this claim of identity.  \n \n6.13 A risk-based approach \n \nR28(12) provides that to comply with the requirement to take CDD measures, you must \nreflect: \n• the PWRA (R18); and \n• your assessment of the level of risk arising in any particular case i.e., the \nclient/matter risk assessment.",

As such, a trust cannot be your client. \nWhen advising in relation to a trust, your client may be: \n \n• the settlor; \n• the trustee(s); \n• the protector(s); or \n• one or more of the beneficiaries. \n \nYour client(s) will be the person to whom you owe your duty of care and who will receive \nthe benefit of your advice. \n \nWhere an express trust has yet to be established and you are providing tax or \ntransactional advice to a prospective settlor in anticipation of creating a trust, your client \nwill usually be the settlor. Your responsibilities to verify the identity of the client and their \nsource of funds, is then no different to any other client, except that you will also need to \nunderstand the nature and extent of the assets that will be settled on the trust. \n \n6.14.12.2 Specific CDD requirements when instructed in relation to an existing trust \n \nWhere you are instructed in relation to an existing trust, when applying CDD: you must \nobtain and verify the identity of your client including beneficial owners where applicable: \n \n• where you act for several beneficiaries (subject to conflicts issues), you must \nobtain and verify the identity of each of them, unless you are acting for them as \na class (in which case you should identify the class by its name); \n• you must, where your client has had a trust funding role, understand your client’s \nsource of wealth and the source of funds which were contributed (or which were \nused to acquire assets which were contributed) to the trust; \n• you must understand the nature and extent of the assets settled on the trust; and \n• you must understand and record the identity of the (non-client) settlor, trustee(s), \nprotector(s), and/or beneficiary(is) and any person who otherwise has control of \nthe trust, as trust beneficial owners. \n \nIf the trust is a relevant trust for registration, you must also identify potential \nbeneficiaries. \n \nIf, when you carried out CDD in relation to a trust (or legal entity/arrangement other \nthan a body corporate) the beneficiaries were designated as a class you must \nestablish and verify the identity of any beneficiary before you are involved in the \npayment to, or exercising of rights of, a specified beneficiary.  \n \nWhen applying CDD to a trust, or any other legal arrangement/entity which is not a \ncompany, involving a class of beneficiaries, you must always verify the identity of the \nbeneficiary or beneficiaries before any payment is made to them or they exercise their \nvested rights in the trust or legal entity/arrangement (R 30 (7)). \n \n\n \n \n6.14.12.3 CDD where the identified client (i.e., the trustee or the settlor) of a trust is an entity  \n \nIf the identified beneficial owner is an entity, you may need to understand who its \nultimate beneficial owners are, depending on the entity's status (e.g., whether it is a \ncompany or some other type of entity).  \n \nThe extent of the measures you take to identify the ultimate beneficial owner of one of the \ntrust’s defined ‘beneficial owners’ will depend on its role in relation to the trust. The ultimate \nbeneficial owner of a settlor, protector or sole beneficiary entity should be fully identified. \n \n6.14.12.4 Who is a ‘beneficiary’ for the purposes of CDD where you act in relation to trusts? \n \nR6(1) implies that individual beneficiaries need not be identified in CDD unless it has been \ndetermined that they will benefit from the trust. That is, unless and until they have a vested \ninterest in the capital of the trust. \n \nIf you do not note all individual beneficiaries named in the trust deed or any associated \ndocument on the basis that their benefit from the trust has not yet been determined, you \nmust identify any named class of beneficiaries, by its description. For example: \n \n• grandchildren of [X]; or \n• charity [Y]. \n \nAs CDD can only take account of circumstances at a point in time, you should note the \nnames of all discretionary beneficiaries (including those who have yet to acquire determined \ninterests) named in the trust deed and any document from the settlor relating to the trust, \nsuch as a letter of wishes. Their interests may vest (or otherwise be determined) while you \nare acting in relation to the trust, thus bringing them within the group of individuals who need \nto be noted in CDD as beneficiaries, as defined in R6(1)(c). \n \nWhen considering the identity of those in whose main interest a trust is set up or \noperates and there are several classes of beneficiary, consider which class is most \nlikely to receive most of the trust property. For example: \n \n• where a trust is for the issue of [X], then the class is the issue of [X] as there is only \none class; \n• where a trust is for the children of [X], if they all die, for the grandchildren of [X] \nand if they all die for charity [Y], then the class is likely to be the children of [X] as \nit is unlikely that they will all die before the funds are disbursed; or \n• where a discretionary trust allows for payments to the widow, the children, their \nspouses and civil partners, the grandchildren and their spouses and civil partners \nthen all interests are equal, and all classes will need to be identified. \n \nWhen in doubt about which class has the main interest, you should identity all \nclasses. \n \nHowever, where you act in relation to a discretionary trust, if you decide against noting in \nyour CDD the names of individual beneficiaries who are named in the trust deed or any \nassociated document on the basis that their benefitting from the trust has not yet been \ndetermined, you will need to seek regular updates from your client, as part of your on-going \n\n \n \nmonitoring measures on a risk-based approach. This may include when and whether \nbeneficiaries’ interests in the trust will be or have been determined. \n \nThe wider approach, involving noting all beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries named \nin the trust deed and any associated document at CDD outset, may therefore be \npreferable from the outset. \n6.14.12.5 What does ‘an individual who has control over the trust’ mean? \nR6(1)(e) brings any individual who has control over the trust within the definition of \nthe beneficial owners of a trust and they will therefore need to be identified when you \nact in relation to a trust. \n \nR6(2) defines control as a power, whether exercisable alone, jointly or with the consent of \nanother, under the trust instrument or by law to: \n \n• dispose of, advance, lend, invest, pay or apply trust property; \n• vary or terminate the trust; \n• add or remove a person as a beneficiary or to or from a class of beneficiaries; \n• appoint or remove trustees or give another individual control over the trust; or \n• direct, withhold consent to or veto the exercise of one of the above powers. \n \nR6(4)(b) specifically excludes from the definition of an individual who has control over a \ntrust an individual ('P') who has control solely as a result of: \n \n• P's consent being required in accordance with section 32(1)(c) (power of \nadvancement) of the Trustee Act 1925; \n• any discretion delegated to P under section 34 (power of investment and \ndelegation) of the Pensions Act 1995; \n• the power to give a direction conferred on P by section 19(2) (appointment and \nretirement of trustee at instance of beneficiaries) of the Trusts of Land and \nAppointment of Trustees Act 1996; or \n• the power exercisable collectively at common law to vary or extinguish a trust \nwhere the beneficiaries under the trust are of full age and capacity and (taken \ntogether) absolutely entitled to the property subject to the trust (or, in Scotland, \nhave a full and unqualified right to the fee). \n \n6.14.12.6 CDD implications arising from the register of beneficial owners of taxable relevant trusts \n \nIf you or your practice on occasions acts as (as opposed to for) a trustee of a taxable \nrelevant trust, pursuant to R44 of the Regulations you will need to maintain accurate and \nup to date records of all beneficial owners and potential beneficiaries of the trust. \n \nEven if your practice is also acting for the trustee(s) and has applied CDD, this may involve \nyou in more extensive investigations. \n \nA taxable relevant trust is: \n \n• a UK express trust, meaning that either all the trustees are resident in the UK or \nat least one trustee is UK resident and the settlor was UK resident and domiciled \nwhen the trust was set up or when the settlor added funds to it; or \n\n \n \n• any other (non-UK) express trust which, in any tax year, becomes liable to pay \none or more of UK income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land \ntax, land and buildings transaction tax or stamp duty reserve tax in relation to UK \nincome or assets. \n \nIf you form a business relationship in your role as trustee with a relevant person, which \ncould be an advisory relationship with your practice (if it is subject to the Regulations), \nyou will need to inform the relevant person that you are acting as a trustee and, on \nrequest, provide the relevant person with information identifying the trust’s beneficial \nowners and potential beneficiaries. \n \nThat obligation lies on (external) trustees of relevant trusts who enter into transactions in \nrelation to which you or your practice are required to apply CDD or who form a business \nrelationship with you or your practice (if you are subject to the Regulations). This should \nassist you in your compliance with your CDD obligations and is another reason why it \nmakes sense to extend your CDD in relation to a relevant trust's beneficial owners also to \ncover potential beneficiaries. \n \nOtherwise, from a reputational risk and advisory perspective, as law enforcement \nauthorities may gain access to information not only about the trust’s beneficial owners as \ndefined in R6(1) but also the names of those individuals who are referred to in any \ndocument from the settlor, such as a letter of wishes, relating to the trust, it is prudent to \nnote such wider information in your CDD records where you act for any client in relation to \na relevant trust, and where you act in relation to any trust. \n6.14.12.7 Practical considerations of CDD for trusts \n \nApplying CDD where you act in relation to an existing trust should generally involve your \nhaving sight of the trust deed or documents which relates to it and obtaining an \nappropriate understanding of their content. In some circumstances, this understanding of \nthe content may come from an explanatory note provided by another professional \nregulated for AML to a similar standard. The rationale for obtaining such evidence in this \nmanner should be documented. \n \nIn low-risk situations (as determined by appropriate and thorough documented risk \nassessment) you may be able to record an account of the terms of the trust given by the \nclient or another regulated person who has had an involvement with setting up or \nmanaging the trust. However, before doing so, you should be assured that the reason for \nyour not being provided with the trust deed and any document which relates to it makes \nsense in all circumstances, is recorded by you and is not indicative of a higher risk of \nmoney laundering. \n \nYou will also need to assure yourself that in identifying the trust’s beneficial owners, the \nclient or other regulated person, as appropriate, had proper regard to whether they \nincluded any individual (other than the settlor, the trustees and the beneficiaries) who has \ncontrol over the trust, and potential beneficiaries.",

    "content": "6.14.5 Meeting clients face to face \n \nThe following sources may be useful for verification of UK-based clients: \n \n• current, signed passport, driving license or birth certificate; \n• marriage certificate (e.g., particularly useful for evidencing name changes);  \n• current government-issued identity card/certificate with photograph (e.g., gun license); \n• residence permit issued by the Home Office; \n• photographic registration cards for self-employed individuals and partnerships in \nthe construction industry; \n• benefit book or original notification letter confirming the right to benefits; \n• a tax or utility bill or statement, or a certificate from a utility supplier confirming \nan arrangement to pre-pay for services; \n• a recent bank or mortgage statement/passbook from an FCA-regulated lender; \n• confirmation from an electoral register that a person of that name lives at that \naddress; \n• land registry confirmation of address; \n• local council or housing association rent card or tenancy agreement; or \n• house or motor insurance certificate. \n \n\n \n \nWhere you are provided with an electronic copy of a document (such as a downloaded \nbank statement) you should continue to take a risk-based approach while being conscious \nthat its value as proof of address may be less than a standard hard copy. \n \nPart of the reason to accept documents such as a hard copy posted bank statement and \nletters from government agencies is to demonstrate that the individual has access to the \nproperty to which they were delivered. Part of that comfort is removed when print outs of \nelectronic statements/bills are used.  This does not mean that such print- outs cannot be \naccepted but this loss of comfort should be considered on a risk sensitive basis.   \n \nIf documents are in a foreign language you should take appropriate steps to be \nsatisfied that the documents in fact provide evidence of the client's identity and \nmore generally that you understand what they say. Unless you have a sufficient \nlevel of understanding of the language, you should consider engaging the services \nof a translator. \n \nYou should be mindful that some aspects of an individual’s identity (particularly \nname and/or sex) may change over time for entirely legitimate reasons, for \nexample due to a change in sex or gender, or due to other life events such as a \nmarriage or discretionary change of name. Such changes should not be used as a \nreason to withhold legal services in isolation, or necessarily interpreted as an \nindicator of higher AML risk  \n \n6.14.6 Natural Persons not able to meet face to face  \n \nIn the case of persons you cannot meet face to face, consideration should be given to any \ngeographic/jurisdictional (which could be at a regional or national level) risks this may \npresent (see risk assessment section of this guidance for further information).  \n \nThe client's address may be identified or verified via: \n \n• an official overseas source; \n• a reputable directory; or \n• a person regulated to an equivalent standard for money laundering purposes in \nthe country where the person is resident who confirms that the client is known to \nthem and lives or works at the address given. \n \nWhen you do not meet the client, you should consider the reason for this and whether this \nrepresents an additional risk which should be taken into account in your risk assessment of \nthe client and the extent of the due diligence measures you apply. EID&V may be a \nparticularly useful tool in these circumstances. \n \n6.14.7 Clients unable to produce standard documentation \nSometimes clients are unable to provide standard verification documents. The purpose of \nthe Regulations is not to deny people access to legal services for legitimate transactions, \nbut to mitigate the risk of legal services being used for the purposes of money laundering. \nYou should consider whether the inability to provide you with standard verification is \nconsistent with the client's profile and circumstances or whether it might make you \nsuspicious that money laundering or terrorist financing is occurring. \n \n\n \n \nIf you decide that a client has a good reason for not meeting the standard verification \nrequirements, you may accept a letter from an appropriate person who knows the \nindividual and can verify the client's identity. \n \nFor example: \n• Clients in care homes might be able to provide a letter from the manager; \n• For elderly clients, you may be able to accept a letter from a General Medical \nPractitioner; \n• Clients without a permanent residence might be able to provide a letter from a \nhouseholder named on a current council tax bill or a hostel manager, confirming \ntemporary residence; \n• A refugee might be able to provide a letter from the Home Office confirming refugee \nstatus and granting permission to work, or a Home Office travel document for \nrefugees; \n• An asylum seeker might be able to provide their registration card and any other \nidentity documentation they hold, or a letter of assurance as to identity from a \ncommunity member such as a religious official, GP, or local councillor who has \nknowledge of the client; \n• A student or minor might be able to provide a birth certificate and confirmation of \ntheir parent's address or confirmation of address from the register of the school or \nhigher education institution; or \n• A person with mental health problems or mental incapacity might know medical \nworkers, hostel staff, social workers, deputies or guardians appointed by the court \nwho can locate identification documents or confirm the client's identity. \n \n6.14.8 Professionals \n \nWhere other professionals use your services, in their capacity as a professional (e.g., when \nrepresenting a client or on behalf of their practice) you may consider using Simplified Due \nDiligence as per R37. \n \nWhere other professionals use your services in their capacity as a private individual, you \nwill still need to complete full due diligence on them as you would with any other private \nindividual. In order to verify their identity and business address you may consult their \nprofessional directory or register along with other sources. Being a regulated professional \nshould not lead to automatic treatment as being low risk in all cases. \n \nYou may consider the section on SDD in this context. \n \n6.14.9 Persons acting on behalf of the client \n \nIn accordance with R28(10) where a person (the intermediary, agent or representative) \npurports to act on behalf of your client, you must: \n• verify that the intermediary, agent or representative is authorised to act on your \nclient’s behalf (i.e., obtain written confirmation from your client); \n• identify the intermediary, agent or representative; and \n• verify the identity of the intermediary, agent or representative on the basis \nof documents and information from a reliable source which is independent \n\n \n \nof both the representative and the client e.g., via a copy of their passport or \ndriving license. \nSomeone employed by your client (depending on their position or seniority) or a \ndirector of your client may be considered as having apparent or ostensible \nauthority to provide instructions on behalf of the client, though you may seek \ncomfort of this on a risk sensitive basis.  They should not be considered to be \nintermediaries, agents or representatives. Where it is not clear or apparent what \ntheir authority to instruct on behalf of the client is, CDD should not be considered to \nbe complete.  \nFor further information please also refer to 6.6 and 6.7. \n \n6.14.10 Non-natural persons \n \nR28(3A) states that where the customer is a legal person, trust, company, foundation or \nsimilar legal arrangement the relevant person must  (having identified and verified the \ncustomer in line with R28(2))  take reasonable measures to understand the ownership and \ncontrol structure of that legal person, trust, company, foundation or similar legal \narrangement. This is a wider concept than simply identifying the beneficial owners.  \n“Reasonable measures” means taking steps that are risk-based, proportionate and effective \nin mitigating the identified money laundering and terrorism financing risks inherent in the \nclient or matter being undertaken. When considering this test of reasonableness, you should \nconsider whether the information is likely to assist in addressing the money laundering risks \nand that you are comfortable that you would be able to demonstrate and evidence the extent \nto which you have sought such information, to your supervisor upon request. It should not be \nmisinterpreted as an allowance to not fulfil your duty to understand the overall ownership \nand control structure of the client.  \nYou should also bear in mind that under regulation 33(6)(a)(vi) corporate structures which \nare unusual or excessively complex given the nature of the company's business, are noted \nas a specific risk factor. This may in turn require enhanced due diligence which could \ninclude, among other things, seeking additional independent, reliable sources to verify \ninformation provided to you, pursuant to regulation 33(5)(a). \nRegulations 28(3) and (4) set out that you must obtain and verify the client’s registered \ndetails and, subject to Regulation 28(5), identify the beneficial owner (where there is one). \nYou must also (subject to Regulation 28(5)) take reasonable measures to: \n• determine and verify the law to which the body corporate is subject, its constitution and \nthe full names of its board of directors or equivalent, and the senior persons responsible \nfor the operations of the body corporate; and \n• verify the identity of the any beneficial owner so that you are satisfied that you know who \nthe beneficial owner is.  \n  \nAgain, subject to Regulation 28(5), you must also take reasonable measures to understand \nthe ownership and control structure of the client entity (as per R28(3A) noted above) and of \nthe beneficial owner if it is a non-natural person. This does not simply mean looking at \npercentages of ownership but also identifying individuals with control and directing power, as \noutlined in regulations 5 and 6. You should document your overarching understanding of the \nindividual’s background, circumstances and nature of the transaction. \n  \n\n \n \nUnder regulation 28(18)(a), “verify” means confirmation based on documents or information \nobtained from a reliable, independent source.  \n \nRegulation 28(5) sets out the measures that do not apply where the client is a company \nlisted on a regulated market. \n  \nUnder regulation 28(18)(b), documents issued by an official body are considered \nindependent, even if provided or made available by the client or on their behalf. This might \nbe significant, for example, where a register was only accessible to the client. \nWhere applicable having regard to the circumstances, you should verify the identity of the \nbeneficial owner(s) to the equivalent standards as that applied to clients who are natural \npersons, as described in 6.14 and/or 6.14.4. In other, lower risk situations and in limited \ncircumstances (such as when the relevant person already knows and has previously verified \nthe identity of the beneficial owner) taking reasonable measures to verify the beneficial \nowner may mean, for example, taking verification information from non-independent \nsources. To evidence why verification of beneficial owners through personal identity \ndocuments is not undertaken, it is important to document your overarching understanding of \nthe individual’s background, circumstances and nature of the transaction. \nIt is important to note that you are seeking to verify the beneficial owner’s identity, not simply \nthat the identity in question is a beneficial owner. You may consider a range of sources to do \nthis provided they are appropriate to the risk posed by the client or matter.   \nWhere you have been unable to verify the identity of the beneficial owners of a non-natural \nperson, you should consider the reasons for this and whether this should lead to a disclosure \nto the NCA. Further consideration should be given to whether to act or continue to act for the \nclient, particularly where the complexity of the structures is out of your normal scope of \nbusiness or make completing CDD difficult. \nYou should record all of your considerations as a part of the client or matter risk assessment, \nfor more information see Section 5.",

Other jurisdictions may equally pose higher ML \nrisks – these should be assessed as part of client and matter risk assessments, and \nadditional, enhanced due diligence measures should be applied accordingly. \n \n6.19.2 Other situations of higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing \n \nEnhanced due diligence is also required where there is a higher risk of money laundering \nor terrorist financing. In determining whether there is a higher risk of money laundering or \nterrorist financing in a given case, you must consider the risk factors set out in R33(6), \nalong with the outcomes of your practice-wide, client and matter risk assessments.  \n \nInstances of high risk as detailed in your supervisor’s risk assessment and in the National \nRisk Assessment also require EDD to be applied. \n \nPlease see the features outlined in Section 5 and 18 of this guidance for further \ninformation. You should consider the situation in context of the CDD information held on \nyour client, including their background and financial circumstances. \n \n \nRegulation 33(6) – Risk Factors you must consider when determining whether to \napply EDD \n\n \n \n \nWhen assessing whether there is a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing in \na particular situation, and the extent of the measures which should be taken to manage \nand mitigate that risk, relevant persons must take account of risk factors including, \namong other things—  \n \n(a)customer risk factors, including whether—  \n(i) the business relationship is conducted in unusual circumstances;  \n(ii) the customer is resident in a geographic area of high risk (see sub-paragraph (c));  \n(iii) the customer is a legal person or legal arrangement that is a vehicle for holding \npersonal assets;  \n(iv) the customer is a company that has nominee shareholders or shares in bearer form;  \n(v) the customer is a business that is cash intensive;  \n(vi) the corporate structure of the customer is unusual or excessively complex given the \nnature of the company’s business;  \n(vii) the customer is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy; o \n(viii) the customer is a third country national who is applying for residence rights in or \ncitizenship of an EEA state in exchange for transfers of capital, purchase of a property, \ngovernment bonds or investment in corporate entities in that EEA state; \n \n(b)product, service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors, including whether—  \n(i) the product involves private banking;  \n(ii) the product or transaction is one which might favour anonymity;  \n(iii) the situation involves non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, without \ncertain safeguards, such as an electronic identification process which meets the \nconditions set out in regulation 28(19);  \n(iv) payments will be received from unknown or un-associated third parties;  \n(v) new products and new business practices are involved, including new delivery \nmechanisms, and the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-\nexisting products;  \n(vi) the service involves the provision of nominee directors, nominee shareholders or \nshadow directors, or the formation of companies in a third country;  \n(vii) there is a transaction related to oil, arms, precious metals, tobacco products, cultural \nartefacts, ivory or other items related to protected species, or other items of \narchaeological, historical, cultural or religious significance or of rare scientific value \n \n(c) geographic risk factors, including—  \n(i) countries identified by credible sources, such as FATF mutual evaluations, detailed \nassessment reports or published follow-up reports, as not having effective systems to \ncounter money laundering or terrorist financing;  \n(ii) countries identified by credible sources as having significant levels of corruption or \nother criminal activity, such as terrorism (within the meaning of section 1 of the Terrorism \nAct 2000(86)), money laundering, and the production and supply of illicit drugs;  \n(iii) countries subject to sanctions, embargos or similar measures issued by, for example, \nthe European Union or the United Nations;  \n(iv) countries providing funding or support for terrorism;  \n(v) countries that have organisations operating within their territory which have been \ndesignated—  \n(aa) by the government of the United Kingdom as proscribed organisations under \nSchedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000(87), or  \n(bb) by other countries, international organisations or the European Union as terrorist \norganisations; and \n(vi) countries identified by credible sources, such as evaluations, detailed assessment \nreports or published follow-up reports published by the Financial Action Task Force, the \n\n \n \nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development or other international bodies or non-governmental \norganisations as not implementing requirements to counter money laundering and \nterrorist financing that are consistent with the recommendations published by the \nFinancial Action Task Force in February 2012 and updated in June 2019. \n \nAs well as considering the risks identified above, you should have regard to any of the risk \nfactors discussed in Section 5 that may be present in a given client or matter.",

In order to treat \nPEPs in a risk-based way, it is a precondition that you can correctly identify them.  \n6.19.3.1 Who is a PEP? \n \nA PEP is a person who has been entrusted within the last year (or for a longer period if \nyou consider it appropriate to address the risks in relation to that person) with one of the \nfollowing prominent public functions by a public institution, an international body, or a \nstate, including the UK. \n \nListing of PEP roles R35(14) \n• heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant \nministers; \n• members of parliament or similar legislative bodies; \n• members of governing bodies of political parties; \n• members of supreme courts, of constitutional courts, or any judicial body \nwhose decisions are not subject to further appeal, except in exceptional \ncircumstances; \n• members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks; \n• ambassadors, charges d'affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces; \n• members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of \nstate-owned enterprises; or \n• directors, deputy directors and members of the board of equivalent function of \nan international organisation. \n \nIn addition to the primary PEPs listed above, a PEP also includes (R35(12)): \n• family members of a PEP – spouse, civil partner, children, their spouses or \npartners, and parents; and \n• known close associates of a PEP – persons with whom joint beneficial \nownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement is held, with whom there are \nclose business relationships, or who is a sole beneficial owner of a legal entity \nor arrangement set up by the primary PEP. \n \n \nMiddle ranking and junior officials are not PEPs. In the UK, only those who hold truly \nprominent positions should be treated as PEPs and the definition should not be applied to \nlocal government, more junior members of the civil service or military officials other than \n\n \n \nthose holding the most senior ranks. This should be borne in mind as many commercially \navailable PEP checking tools may have a much lower threshold for considering an \nindividual a PEP. \n \nIn the Government consultation on 5MLD, it was strongly suggested that the FCA’s \nguidance on PEPs should be the standard across the board.  \n \nSection FCA guidance sets out the FCA’s view of what categories of person should be \ntreated as PEPs in the UK (building on the above). \n \n6.19.3.2 Identifying a PEP \n \nR35(1) requires you to have appropriate risk management systems and procedures to \ndetermine whether a client or beneficial owner is a PEP. \n \nPractices must take a risk-based approach to identifying PEPs. \n \nTo assess your risk of encountering a PEP, you must consider your PWRA, the level of \nrisk of money laundering or terrorist financing inherent in your business and the extent \nto which that risk would be increased by a business relationship with a PEP. \n \nIn larger or more specialist practices where it may be reasonably expected to undertake \nwork on behalf of PEPs in the normal or regular course of business, frequency and \nintensity of PEP screening should be increased (potentially using an established \ncommercial provider), both at the outset of the matter and an ongoing basis. Many \npractices use services that can run checks against PEP databases which they maintain.  \n \nWhere you have a higher risk of having PEPs as clients or you have reason to suspect that \na person may actually be a PEP contrary to earlier information, you should consider \nconducting some form of electronic verification.  \n \nThe range of PEPs is wide and constantly changing, so any EID&V will not give you total \ncertainty. You should have reference to Section 7 when considering the possible \nconfidence you may place in the abilities of any EID&V tool. \n \nRegardless of the result of any single check you should consider the wider possibility that \nyour client is a PEP. \n \nQuestions you should ask with regard to PEP Status \n• What role(s) does the individual hold? \n• What is the nature and context of business relationship?  \n• What services or products does the PEP wish to use?  \n• What is the potential for the product to be misused for the purposes of \ncorruption? \n• Do you know if they have close family members or known associates and if so, \nwhat roles do they hold? \n• What level of public scrutiny, exposure, governance, disclosures or accountability \nin their role is the PEP subject to? \n• Are their accompanying geographic risks associated with the PEP relationship? \n• If you have identified a PEP, were they helpful in providing this information and if \nnot, should and how would this impact my assessment of the risk present? \n\n \n \n• Does the nature of their PEP status impact in the level of EDD that needs to be \napplied, and if so, how? \n \nIn practices where undertaking work on behalf of PEPs is unlikely or a very rare \noccurrence, it may be acceptable to use publicly available or open sources. Checking for \nPEP status should be undertaken on a risk-based approach, in light of other CDD \ninformation held (such as employment) which may lead to the practice suspecting PEP \nstatus.  \n \nSimple measures may include: \n• asking the client or their representative (as appropriate) whether the person is a \nPEP, as a part of client onboarding; \n• performing an internet search in order to check whether the individual may hold \nany position that qualifies them as a PEP; or \n• reviewing the information, they submit to you carefully to determine whether any \ninformation you have access to, suggests they may be a PEP. \n \n \nOther indicators that may indicate your client is a PEP include: \n \n• receiving funds from a government account; \n• correspondence on official letterhead from the client or a related person; \n• information from the client or person related to the matter linking the client to a PEP; \nand \n• any information which comes to your attention suggesting your client is actually \na PEP or linked to one. \n \nWhere you suspect a client is a PEP but cannot establish that for certain, you should \nconsider what steps you could take in order to resolve this uncertainty. If you are not able to \nresolve the issue to your satisfaction, you may consider (on a risk-based approach) \napplying aspects of enhanced due diligence procedures (as a lack of clarity as to whether \na person is a PEP could, in and of itself, be indicative of a heightened risk of money \nlaundering). \n \nIt is worth reiterating from the outset that family members of PEPs, and known close \nassociates of PEPs, must be treated as PEPs in terms of the due diligence you apply.   \nYou should apply the same standard of investigation when identifying whether someone is \na family member of a PEP, as you do for a PEP. \n \nR35(15) sets out a different process for “known close associates.” \n \n“For the purpose of deciding whether a person is a known close associate of a politically \nexposed person, a relevant person need only have regard to information which is in its \npossession, or to credible information which is publicly available.” This means that you are \nonly expected to be able to identify a known close associate where the information you \nalready hold tells you that this is what they are, or if it is publicly available. \n \n6.19.3.3 Mitigation of PEP Risk \n \nIn deciding what risk mitigation to apply you must (R35(2)) take account of: \n\n \n \n• your PWRA; \n• the client or matter risk assessment; and \n• any information published by your supervisor. \nPEPs may pose a higher risk, by virtue of having a greater potential opportunity to be \ninvolved in corruption, due to the positions or access to public funds they hold. Being a \nPEP should not, preclude access to legal services, provided the practice undertakes the \nnecessary enhanced due diligence measures. \n \nSince 10 January 2024 the regulations state that in relation to domestic PEPs, that is, \nthose entrusted with prominent public functions by the United Kingdom: \n• the starting point for the assessment is that the client or potential client presents a \nlower level of risk than a non-domestic PEP, and \n• if no enhanced risk factors are present, the extent of EDD measures to be applied \nin relation to that client or potential client is less than the extent to be applied in the \ncase of a non-domestic PEP. \nWhen there is a PEP relationship (including where a PEP is a beneficial owner of a \nclient and where a client or its beneficial owner is a family member or known close \nassociate of a PEP), the Regulations specify that you must take the following steps to \ndeal with the heightened risk: \n \n• have senior management approval for establishing a business relationship \nwith a PEP or an entity beneficially owned by a PEP; \n• take adequate measures to establish the SoF and SoW which are involved in the \nbusiness relationship or occasional transaction; \n• conduct closer ongoing monitoring of the business relationship; and \n• consider which aspects of your EDD protocol are appropriate for the PEP in \nquestion. \n \nWhere you have a beneficial owner who you know to be a PEP, you should consider on a \nrisk-based approach what extra EDD measures, you need to take when dealing with that \nclient. \n \nWhere the client is a state-owned entity and the PEP in question is only a PEP due to \ntheir position in the State-Owned Entity, you may consider whether this mitigates the risks \npresent. \n \nA useful source of further information is the FCA's guidance on the treatment of politically \nexposed persons for anti-money laundering purposes. The guidance is aimed at practices \nsupervised by the FCA, but you should take it into account in accordance with \nR35(4)(b)(i). \n \n6.19.3.4 Senior management approval for onboarding a PEP \n \nR3(1) defines 'senior management' as: \n \nAn  officer  or  employee  of  the  relevant  person  with sufficient  knowledge  of  the  relevant \nperson's money laundering and terrorist financing risk exposure, and of sufficient authority to \ntake decisions affecting its risk exposure. \n \n\n \n \nThe FCA guidance referred to above sets out their view as to who, for the purposes of the \nRegulations, should be treated as coming within the definition of senior management. \n \nFor legal practices, senior management may be: \n• a member of the board of directors or equivalent senior management team; \n• the head of a practice group or department or function; \n• a senior or managing partner; or \n• the MLRO or, if different, the MLCO. \n \nOther individuals may fall into this category depending on the nature and structure of your \npractice. \n \nSenior Management may delegate the application of their roles to other suitably senior \nand competent individuals however they remain ultimately responsible and accountable. \nYou should advise those responsible for monitoring risk assessments that a business \nrelationship with a PEP has begun, to help their overall monitoring of the practice's risk \nprofile and compliance. \n \nFor sole practitioners, you should appropriately record your decision e.g., as a conclusion \nto the client or matter risk assessment.",

The Regulations are not prescriptive about \nexactly what must be included in EDD, with the exception of clients that are PEPs. \n \nAs per R33(5), EDD may include (while not being restricted to): \no seeking additional independent, reliable sources to verify information provided or \nmade available to you; \no taking additional measures to understand better the background, ownership and \nfinancial situation of the customer, and other parties to the transaction; \no taking further steps to be satisfied that the transaction is consistent with the purpose \nand intended nature of the business relationship; or \no increasing the monitoring of the business relationship, including greater scrutiny of \ntransactions. \nIn the case of a High Risk Third Country (HRTC), EDD is more restrictive. \n \nIf you are establishing a business relationship with a client in a HRTC, you will need to \napply the EDD including the steps below. You will also need to apply the steps below when \n\n \n \neither your client or the counterparty is established in a HRTC where you are undertaking \nan occasional transaction (within the meanings of R27(1)(b) and (2)). \n \nIn these circumstances, EDD must include: \no obtaining additional information on the client and on the client’s beneficial owner; \no obtaining additional information on the intended nature of the business relationship; \no obtaining information on the source of funds and the source of wealth of the client \nand the client’s beneficial owner; \no obtaining information on the reasons for the transactions; \no obtaining the approval of senior management for establishing or continuing the \nbusiness relationship; and \no conducting enhanced monitoring of the business relationship including increasing the \nfrequency and number of checks or other controls applied; and selecting patterns of \ntransactions that trigger a requirement of further explanation to your practice.  \nIf a client with whom you have a business relationship (not in a HRTC) is engaging in a \ntransaction where the counterparty is based in a HRTC, you should consider the risks this \npresents and whether it is appropriate to apply EDD to the transaction. \n \nYou should also consider whether it is appropriate to go beyond the above minimum \nrequirements, particularly in circumstances of higher risk or where you have identified red \nflags. This may include for example seeking greater verification of the client’s identity, \nbackground and circumstances from independent and reliable information sources. It may \nalso mean lowering beneficial ownership thresholds to 25% or less or conducting further \nscreening or adverse media searches on directors or beneficial owners of the client. \n \n6.18.3 Establishing source of wealth \n(Please also see 16.7.3) \nAn important additional EDD measure should include understanding the financial situation of \nthe client – in practice this means taking additional measures to understand the SoW as well \nas the SoF of the client.  \n  \nYou should consider the level and nature of verification required in light of the risks posed by \nthe client, transaction and/or business relationship. \n \nAs part of your EDD process you should verify the SoW with evidence obtained from the client \nand/or independent sources until you are comfortable that you understand where the client's  \noverall wealth has been derived from and (to the best of your knowledge) that it is legitimate. \nYou should document your rationale in a file note. \nWhen addressing SoW, you should consider whether the SoW is commensurate to your client \nin general i.e., does it make sense that the client in front of you obtained their wealth in the \nway that they have advised you? \n \nThe SoW refers to the origin of a client’s entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets). This \ninformation will usually give an indication as to the volume of wealth the client would be \nexpected to have, and a picture of how the person acquired such wealth. \n \nIt does not however require you to account for all of a client’s assets, but to build a rationale \nand reasoning as to why they have such wealth and to provide assurance that it was \n\n \n \nobtained through legal means. This will help you to establish whether the transaction makes \nsense. \n \nIn many complex scenarios it may be difficult to determine original sources of wealth, \npossibly accrued many years ago. In such scenarios, reasonable efforts must be \nundertaken to obtain relevant information from the client, and this must be reviewed in light \nof other risk factors, such as jurisdictional/geographic risk, adverse media, PEP status and \ntransaction type (especially transactions which may help obscure the ownership or transfer \nof assets). \n \nAlthough a practice may not have specific information about assets not deposited or \nprocessed by them, it may be possible to gather general information from commercial \ndatabases or other open sources. \n \nWhere the client’s SoW is not readily apparent, the first step in establishing either SoF \nor SoW is asking questions of your client and where appropriate seeking independent \nverification and corroboration of information across a variety of sources, to build a \npicture of the client’s background and circumstance which may require asking questions \nof the client. \n \nActions taken, documentation and materials reviewed, and decisions taken (including \nrationale) must be clearly recorded. These may be reviewed at a later date by your \nsupervisor or other relevant authorities. \n \nWhere you cannot successfully establish the SoW in higher risk situations, you should \nconsider ceasing to act for the client and whether you need to submit a report to the \nNCA. \n6.18.4 Enhanced monitoring \nEnhanced ongoing monitoring is automatically required whenever EDD is applied. \n \nOne aspect of keeping transactions under review is to ensure they are still in line with the \nCDD information held on the client, and information contained in the client and matter risk \nassessments. Whatever controls you have in place to monitor other business \nrelationships, may be intensified in order to apply enhanced monitoring.  \n \nThis may include: \n• requiring a greater level of information and explanation from the client when \nactivity diverts from that addressed in their client risk assessment;  \n• greater frequency of checks on transactions, particularly SoF; or \n• undertaking more frequent due diligence checks on your client. \nYou should ensure that funds paid into your client account come from an expected source \nand are for an amount commensurate with the client's known wealth and with what is \nexpected to be deposited in relation to the matters on which you act for them.",

You should consider reviewing (although not necessarily redoing) \nthe CDD upon each new matter. Where there has been a significant gap between \ninstructions (anything above a year may be considered a significant gap in relation to those \nclients or transactions assessed as higher-risk), you should consider refreshing the CDD.  \nYou must update the CDD when you become aware of any changes to the client’s \nidentification information. This would include change of name, address, beneficial owner or \nbusiness. \nIn accordance with R27(9) you must apply (or reapply) CDD to existing clients on a risk-\nbased approach and when you become aware that the circumstances of the existing client \nhave changed. \n \nIn determining this, you must consider: \n \n• any indication that the identity of the client, or beneficial owner has changed; \n• any transactions which are not reasonably consistent with your knowledge of the \nclient; \n• any change in the purpose or nature of the relationship; and \n• any other matter which may affect your assessment of the money laundering or \nterrorist financing risk in relation to the client. \n \nIt may also be necessary to undertake ongoing monitoring through the course of a single \nmatter – particularly where there is an element of duration to the matter, and parties to the \nmatter, or the SoW/SoF involved may have changed. \n \nEach time a practice engages in ongoing monitoring (which may or may not include full \nreverification) it should record: \n \n• what aspects of the issue they considered; \n• action taken (if any); \n• the reasons for that decision; and \n• who undertook the monitoring and the date on which it was undertaken?  \n \nBear in mind also that the Regulations as amended prescribe further situations where you \nmust re-apply CDD for existing clients – these being when a practice has any legal duty in \nthe course of the calendar year to contact a client under the International Tax Compliance \nRegulations 2015 or to review information: \n• relevant to their client risk assessment (or where appropriate practice-wide/matter \nrisk assessment as appropriate); and \n\n \n \n• concerning beneficial ownership information of the customer, including information \nwhich helps them understand the ownership or control structure of any entity that is \nthe beneficial owner of the client.",

In enhanced due diligence situations \nthis requirement is more stringent. \n \nThe financial circumstances of a client can broadly be categorised into Source of Funds \n(SoF), and Source of Wealth (SoW). \n \nA practice must scrutinise transactions on a matter-by-matter basis, with the objective of \nunderstanding what the source of funds are for transactions you undertake on behalf of a \nclient. This is a fundamental aspect of holistic CDD. It is important to remember that \nunderstanding the SoF and SoW is a key protection for your practice, and it should be \napproached as an opportunity to protect your practice from being used for money \nlaundering. \n \nThe type of documentation accepted to verify SoW or SoF should depend on the level of \nML/TF risk presented by the customer. The higher the risk, the more comprehensive and \nreliable documents you obtain should be. \n \nTaking a risk-based approach, you may consider funds remitted from a legal practice \nregulated for AML to equivalent standards as the Regulations as being of lower risk. \n \nYou must take adequate measures to check SoF and SoW as a part of EDD when applied \nto PEPs. You should also consider doing so as a part of ongoing monitoring of any business \nrelationship (whether high risk or otherwise). You should also apply a source of wealth \ncheck in other applications of EDD on a risk-based approach.  \n \nIt is good practice to check the SoF even if a business relationship as defined in the \nRegulations has not been formed, and the matter is an occasional transaction. It should be \nconsidered that checking source of funds is a useful practical tool for protecting your \npractice generally. \n \nIt is important to document the source of funds checks conducted on each client or matter – \nthis may be by way of the collation of information/evidence obtained, and/or the inclusion of \na file note outlining what checks were undertaken, what evidence obtained, and the \nconclusions derived from these checks. \n \nSoF and SoW do not mean the same thing, although there can be significant overlap \nbetween the two and they do not exist in isolation to each other. \n\n \n \n \n6.17.2 Source of Funds \nSource of Funds \nSource of Funds refers to the funds that are being used to fund the specific transaction \nin hand – i.e., the origin of the funds used for the transactions or activities that occur \nwithin the business relationship or occasional transaction.  The question you are \nseeking to answer should not simply be, “where did the money for the transaction \ncome from,” but also “how and from where did the client get the money for this \ntransaction or business relationship.” It is not enough to know the money came from a \nUK bank account. \n \nFor further reference see point 87 in the following FATF guidance here.  \n \n6.17.2.1 Establishing Source of Funds: \n \nThe types of data and documents that you use for verification of Source of Funds will vary \ndepending on the circumstances and the information that the customer provides to you. \n \nThe SoF pertains directly to the funds that are being used to fund the specific transaction in \nhand i.e., the origin of the funds used for the transactions or activities that occur within the \nclient’s business relationship with you. Checking this means ascertaining where those funds \ncame from, how they were accumulated by the client and ensuring on a risk-based approach \nthat they are not the proceeds of crime. \n \nSoF is not simply  limited to knowing from which financial institution the funds in question \nmay have been transferred, except where the financial institution is providing financing for \nthe transaction e.g., via mortgage. It should also not be limited to checking that the client’s \nname matches the name on the account. \nIn addition to documenting the \n• Amount; \n• Currency, and \n• The remitting account details (bank, account number, sort code, name on account)- \n-the information obtained should be substantive and establish a provenance or reason for \nhaving been acquired e.g., salary, gift etc.  \n \nAcquiring bank statements, Wills, full payslips, audited financial accounts showing funds \ndisbursed to the client, sales/purchase agreements, receipts of other transactions or similar \ndocumentation may all be useful in establishing source of funds. Establishing income from \nshare capital, business activities, a bequest of gift etc. can also help you. \n \n \nIn circumstances where it becomes known that a third party is to contribute to funds for a \ntransaction, you should consider also seeking to understand and obtain evidence relating to \nthe third party’s underlying SoF, in the same way you would on the client themselves, with \nthe extent of such measures increasing with risk level. Whether and the extent to which you \nshould obtain, review and evidence third party SoF is dependent upon the risk profile of the \nclient or matter, bearing in mind that accepting payments from unknown or unassociated \nthird parties is a specific risk factor pursuant to 33(6)(b)(iv).  \n\n \n \n \nThe need for and extent of source of funds checks should be informed by your ongoing \nassessment of client and matter risk under regulations 28(11) to (13), and in turn inform \nfuture assessments. You must also bear in mind your obligation under regulation 28(16) to \ndemonstrate that the measures you have taken to carry out due diligence are appropriate, \nwith reference to both your PWRA and the relevant sectoral risk assessment. \n \nIt may be difficult to determine the SoF without some understanding of the underlying SoW \nof the individual. This can particularly be the case where the funds for a transaction have \nbecome mixed with other funds in an account. Here, to understand the SoF, you may need \nto have an awareness of the underlying SoW, although your level of confidence in the SoW \nin such a case, should be considered on a risk-based approach (see  6.17.3 and 6.18.3 for \nfurther guidance on SoW. \n \n6.17.3 Source of Wealth \n \nSource of Wealth \n \nThe source of wealth refers to the origin of a client’s entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets).  \n \nSoW describes the economic, business and/or commercial activities that generated, or \nsignificantly contributed to, the client’s overall net worth/entire body of wealth. This should \nrecognise that the composition of wealth generating activities may change over time, as \nnew activities are identified, and additional wealth is accumulated. \n \nYou should seek to answer the question: “why and how does the individual have the amount \nof overall assets they do – and how did they accumulate/generate these?” \n \nFor further reference see point 88 in the following FATF guidance here.  \n \n \n \nSoW is a holistic appraisal as to where an individual or an entity has derived their overall \nwealth (i.e., the origin of their entire body of assets), rather than any specific portion of it. \nTo check SoW in a low/medium risk transaction, you may be comfortable identifying the SoW \nby asking and recording how the client has accrued their wealth or by verifying the client’s \nbusiness interests through public searches. For low/medium risk transactions in relation to \ncompanies and other body corporate clients you could be comfortable that the intended \ntransaction is consistent with what you know about the company. For guidance in establishing \nSoW in higher risk situations see 6.18.3. \n \nFor further information on source of wealth requirements please see the Enhanced Due \nDiligence section below. \n \nIn-depth guidance on Source of Wealth and Source of Funds requirements has been issued \nby the Wolfsberg Group and can be found here.",

Fighting \ncrime is one of the FCA’s four strategic priorities for 2025-2030 demonstrating \nthe focus on this area.  \n \n2.16 The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 created a new \nregulatory objective in the Legal Services Act 2007 focusing on promoting the \nprevention and detection of economic crime. The Act also removed the \nstatutory cap on financial penalties for the Solicitors Regulation Authority \n(SRA) to ensure the SRA has the necessary enforcement powers and can levy \nfinancial penalties that act as a credible deterrent in relation to economic \ncrime matters. \nCombat criminal use of cryptoassets  \n2.17 Several changes have been made to the MLRs to enhance oversight and \ncontrol of cryptoasset firms since the 2020 NRA. In 2023 the scope of the wire \ntransfer information-sharing regime was extended to cryptoassets (the ‘travel \nrule’) for both domestic and cross-border transfers. Further, since 2023, the \npromotion of certain cryptoassets to UK consumers is subject to the FCA’s \nfinancial promotion rules. In the first year, the FCA issued 1,702 consumer \nalerts about illegal promotions, over 900 scam websites were taken down and \n56 apps removed from UK app stores. \n \n2.18 The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act introduced \nadditional powers for law enforcement, so they are able to more quickly and \neasily seize and recover cryptoassets which are the proceeds of crime or \nassociated with illicit activity such as money laundering, terrorist financing, \nfraud and ransomware attacks. \n \n2.19 Law enforcement has invested in improving both their capacity and \ncapability to investigate the criminal use of cryptoassets. This includes the \n\n \n \nrolling out of new training and upskilling to improve law enforcement officers’ \nunderstanding of cryptoassets, supported by the provision of specialist tooling \n(i.e. blockchain analytics tools) and the building of a new crypto-specific \npublic-private partnership within the existing Joint Money Laundering \nIntelligence Taskforce (JMLIT), which brings together law enforcement and \nmembers of the regulated sector structure. This public-private partnership has \nhelped develop our understanding of the threat and fomented various joint \ninitiatives (including around data sharing).    \n \nImprove intelligence, analysis and feedback through SARs Reform \n2.20 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) intelligence is a critical tool in our ability \nto identify and disrupt criminal activity and recover criminal assets. The SARs \nReform Programme is delivering a new SARs Digital Service (SDS) and has \nprovided an uplift of staff to Regional Organised Crime Units (ROCUs) and the \nUK Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU). The delivery of the new SDS will enable \nthe enhancement of data exploitation, improve feedback and engagement to \nthe regulated sector, enable timelier intelligence sharing with law \nenforcement agencies, improve capacity and capability across HMG and \nprovide more efficient and effective reporting by the regulated sector. \n \nRecover more criminal assets  \n2.21 In addition to the new cryptoassets measures, reforms have been made to \nthe unexplained wealth order (UWO) regime. These amendments extended \nthe class of persons who may be subject to an UWO, amended the income \nrequirement provisions, increased the maximum statutory time period \nafforded to law enforcement to review material, and reformed the cost rules.  \n \n2.22 Further, the Anti-Money Laundering and Asset Recovery (AMLAR) \nProgramme (2023-2026) has been established, funded by the economic crime \nlevy, increasing law enforcement capacity and capabilities.  \n \n2.23 Since 2020, there has been a sustained level of assets recovered with \n£358.4 million recovered in 2021/22, £341.5 million recovered in 2022/23 and \n£243.3 million recovered in 2023/24.  \n \nLead the cross-system operational response to money laundering and \nterrorist financing  \n \n2.24 The NECC continues to be the operational cross-system leaders. For \nexample, in 2024 the NECC, NCA and OPBAS published the Cross System \nProfessional Enablers Strategy. The aim of the strategy is to galvanise a whole \nsystem response to deliver a step-change in reducing the threat posed by \nprofessional enablers. \n\n \n \nFunding and law enforcement capability  \n2.25 The Economic Crime (Anti-Money Laundering) Levy was introduced \nthrough the Finance Act 2022. Following changes to levy rates in the Spring \nBudget 2024, it is now expected to raise around £115 million per year from \nApril 2024 onwards to spend on measures designed to tackle money \nlaundering and economic crime. For the first three years of the levy this \nincluded:  \n• £100 million for state-of-the-art technology to analyse and share data on \nthreats in real time, giving law enforcement the tools it needs to stay \nahead of",

    "content": "Law Society of Scotland AML/CTF Sectoral Risk Assessment \n \nAssessment of international and domestic risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting Scottish \nsolicitors February 2022 \n \nIntroduction, Background & Purpose: \n \nUnder Regulation 17 of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) \nRegulations 2017, the Law Society of Scotland must identify and assess the international and domestic risks of money \nlaundering to which its members are subject. \n \nWhere appropriate, the supervisory authority should make this assessment available to its supervised population, where this \nmight assist relevant persons in undertaking their own money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment. \n \nIn carrying out such a risk assessment supervisors should consider various reports and guidelines issued by authorities such \nas the European Supervisory Authorities, HM Treasury and Home Office. The supervisory authority must also keep an up-to-\ndate record in writing of the steps it has taken under r.17 \n \nWe have therefore identified the below publications as important points of reference for identifying and assessing the \nAML/CTF risks to which Scottish solicitors are subject: \n \n• HM Treasury/Home Office UK National Risk Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (NRA) \n(December 2020)  \n• Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – Money Laundering Vulnerabilities of Legal Professionals (2013) (link) \n• Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach - Guidance for Legal Professionals (June 2019) \n• European Supra-National AML/CTF Risk Assessment Report 2019  \n• National Crime Agency – National Strategic Assessment of Serious & Organised Crime 2021  \n• Scottish Government Serious & Organised Crime in Scotland: A Summary of Evidence (2017)  \n• Scottish Government Serious & Organised Crime Progress Report (2020) \n \n \nWho should use this sectoral risk assessment/who is it aimed at? \n \nThis risk assessment is primarily intended to be used by Scottish solicitors and legal practices who are supervised for AML \npurposes by the Law Society of Scotland \n \nWhat should Practices do with this information? \n \nA core principle of AML compliance is taking a risk-based approach (RBA).  \n \nIn short, an RBA refers to adjusting the level and type of compliance work done (frequency, intensity and/or amount), to the \nrisks present. In order to apply a RBA, it is necessary then to have information on the risks inherent to your practice and in \nany particular client or matter – and the pertinence of these risks - which is why robust risk assessments are so important.  \n \nIf you have not fully assessed the risks present across your business or in any particular client or matter, you cannot then \napply appropriate controls to mitigate those risks adequately and effectively.  \n \nThe resulting benefits of this approach include:  \n \n• More efficient and effective use of resources, proportionate to the risks faced.  \n• Minimising compliance costs and administrative burdens on practices and clients; and  \n• Greater flexibility to respond to emerging risks as money laundering and terrorist financing methods change. \n \nFundamental to this is the undertaking and embedding of a Practice-Wide Risk Assessment (PWRA) into your business, as \nprescribed under r.18 of the Money Laundering Regulations. \n \nPWRAs should be comprehensive in identifying and assessing all the money laundering and terrorist financing risks your \npractice faces. The PWRA is central and fundamental to the AML controls implemented across your business and needs to \naddress certain issues, prescribed by the Regulations. \n \nFurther information regarding PWRA’s can be found in s.5 of the UK Legal Sector Affinity Group (LSAG) Guidance \n \nThis document (along with other resources on our website including the UK Legal Sector AML Guidance) is aimed at \nproviding information to Scottish solicitors to support in the implementation of robust, risk-based and proportionate \nAML measures. \n \nAs per r.18(2a) the information contained in this document must be used to inform your r.18 Practice-Wide Risk \nAssessment (PWRA) \n \n\n \n \nScottish Legal Sectoral Overview: Key Demographics & Stats: \nThe Law Society of Scotland is the Professional Body AML Supervisor for Scottish solicitors.  Of the 1250 practices regulated \nby the Law Society of Scotland, c. 696 currently operate within the scope of the MLRs.  \n \nOur AML Certificate Process \nThe Society’s AML Certificate is an annual compulsory questionnaire issued to in-\nscope practice  units,  consisting  of  c.  50  questions  relating  to  inherent  AML  risk \nfactors. In line with the MLRs and the UK National Risk Assessment, it focuses on a \npractice’s inherent exposure to higher risk clients and areas of practice such as \nconveyancing,  trust  and  company  provision,  along  with  geographic  and  delivery \nchannel risk.  \nOnce  analysed,  the  data  collected  is  used  to  build  a  risk  profile  of  our  supervised \npopulation, and can also allow us to  \nunderstand specific risks, trends, or issues across individual practices.  \nThis profiling mechanism allows the Society to satisfy requirements of r.46 – i.e., to \nadopt a risk-based approach by basing the frequency and intensity of our supervision \naccording to the risk profile of our supervised population.  \nThe  Society  also  sets  out  our  approach  to  risk-based  supervision  and  associated \noutcomes in a Risk Appetite Statement published in February 2021 \n \n \nThrough the analysis of our 2020/21 AML Certificate returns, we have built a risk \nprofile of our in-scope supervised population – we believe that 280 practice units \nrepresent an inherently lower risk of handling the proceeds of crime, 362 are at \nmedium inherent risk and 54 pose an inherently higher risk given the type of \nbusiness activities they undertake, the types of clients they hold and their \ngeographical reach. \nIt is important to note that the risks described in this document may affect all in-\nscope Practices (to a greater or lesser extent) no matter what their risk profile is. \n \nThe analysis of AML certificate information also gives us the ability to identify \nspecific risks within our supervised population and has been used to inform this \nsectoral risk assessment. \n \n \nSnapshot: The Nature and Scale of Serious Organised Crime (SOC), and Associated Money Laundering\n \n \nUK: \n• >70,000 individuals involved in SOC throughout the UK \n• £12bn criminal cash generated annually in UK. \n• The total estimated social and economic cost of SOC each year to the UK is at least £24 billion \n• Scale of ML impacting on the UK hundreds of billions of pounds annually. \nScotland: \n• c. 2,400 individuals involved in SOC in Scotland \n• 112 SOC Groups \n• 72% of SOCGs are located in the West of Scotland, 18% in the East and 10% in the North.  \n• In Scotland, it is estimated that SOC costs the Scottish economy alone (i.e., excluding the social cost) £2 billion per year. \n• 72% of SOCGs are involved in the use of seemingly legitimate businesses. The most common business types are \nlicensed premises, taxis, restaurants, shops, garage repairs and vehicle maintenance, property development, care \nhomes, waste/recycling. \n \nPredicate Crime: \nMoney Laundering is not victimless – it is a serious crime which underpins almost all criminal activity, and the \neffects are felt across Society, and in each and every local community across Scotland: \n \n• 69% of SOCGs are involved in drug crime; heroin is the most popular commodity, followed by cocaine, cannabis, \namphetamine, and tranquilisers.  \n• Other crime types include violence; money laundering; various forms of fraud including cigarette smuggling, counterfeiting \nand tax fraud; human trafficking; acquisitive crime such as vehicle and metal theft; environmental crime such as illegal \ndumping of hazardous materials and cybercrime. \n• Human trafficking (including female and child se",
