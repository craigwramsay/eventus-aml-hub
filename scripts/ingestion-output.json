For all countries identified as high-risk, the FATF calls on all members and urges all jurisdictions to apply enhanced due diligence, and, in the most serious cases, countries are called upon to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing (ML/TF/PF) risks emanating from the country.\n\nJurisdictions subject to a FATF call to apply countermeasures:\n\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK): The FATF remains concerned by the DPRK's continued failure to address the significant deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the serious threats posed by the DPRK's illicit activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and its financing. Countermeasures include: terminate correspondent relationships with DPRK banks; close any subsidiaries or branches of DPRK banks; and limit business relationships and financial transactions with DPRK persons.\n\nIran: The FATF acknowledges Iran's re-engagement but, given Iran's lack of progress on its action plan, the FATF has called upon its members and urged all jurisdictions to apply effective countermeasures in line with Recommendation 19. Iran will remain on the FATF High Risk Jurisdictions list until its full Action Plan has been completed.\n\nJurisdiction subject to a FATF call to apply enhanced due diligence proportionate to risks:\n\nMyanmar: In February 2020, Myanmar committed to address its strategic deficiencies. Given the continued lack of progress, the FATF calls on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced due diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. If no further progress is made by February 2026, the FATF will consider countermeasures.",

Transfers without exchange of funds present equal risk.\n\nClient Accounts (s.5.6.3.2): Putting proceeds of crime through a client account gives funds the appearance of legitimacy. Avoid accepting cash payments to client accounts in relation to transactions. If accepted, treat as high risk within PWRA, particularly where large (e.g. above £1,000). Establish Source of Funds for any cash payments. Do not display client account details on letterheads or websites. Unsolicited payments or unexpected overpayments may have been engineered for money laundering — consider filing a SAR.\n\nFormation of Trusts and Companies (s.5.6.3.3): Company and trust structures may be exploited by criminals wishing to retain control over criminal assets while impeding law enforcement. Consider it high risk if a client engages services only for routine formation without seeking further legal advice. Shell companies — entities without business activities or assets — can disguise beneficial ownership and flow of illegitimate funds.\n\nTrusts CDD (s.6.14.12): Trusts in the UK do not have legal personality. Your client may be the settlor, trustee(s), protector(s), or one or more beneficiaries. When applying CDD to an existing trust you must: obtain and verify the identity of your client including beneficial owners; understand source of wealth and source of funds contributed to the trust; understand the nature and extent of settled assets; and identify the (non-client) settlor, trustee(s), protector(s), beneficiaries, and any person who has control over the trust.\n\nPartnerships CDD (s.6.14.13): A partnership (except in Scotland) is not a separate legal entity — you must obtain information on constituent individuals. For partnerships, beneficial owners are individuals controlling >25% of capital, profits, or voting rights, or who otherwise exercise control over management. For UK LLPs or Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs), apply company CDD requirements. Higher risk where partners are overseas entities in jurisdictions without publicly available corporate registers or where ownership can be concealed through nominees.",

Acquiring bank statements, Wills, full payslips, audited financial accounts, sales/purchase agreements, or similar documentation may all be useful.\n\nSource of Wealth (SoW) (s.6.17.3): Refers to the origin of a client's entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets).

The Act also removed the statutory cap on financial penalties for the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to ensure the SRA has the necessary enforcement powers and can levy financial penalties that act as a credible deterrent in relation to economic crime matters.\n\nProfessional Enablers Strategy: In 2024 the NECC, NCA and OPBAS published the Cross System Professional Enablers Strategy. The aim is to galvanise a whole system response to deliver a step-change in reducing the threat posed by professional enablers — including solicitors who wittingly or unwittingly facilitate money laundering.\n\nSARs Reform: The SARs Reform Programme is delivering a new SARs Digital Service (SDS) to enhance data exploitation, improve feedback and engagement to the regulated sector, enable timelier intelligence sharing with law enforcement, and provide more efficient and effective reporting by the regulated sector.\n\nAsset Recovery: Since 2020, there has been a sustained level of assets recovered: £358.4m recovered in 2021/22, £341.5m in 2022/23, and £243.3m in 2023/24. Reforms to the unexplained wealth order (UWO) regime have extended the class of persons who may be subject to UWOs.\n\nEconomic Crime Levy: The Economic Crime (Anti-Money Laundering) Levy is expected to raise around £115 million per year from April 2024 onwards, funding measures to tackle money laundering and economic crime including £100m for technology to analyse and share threat data in real time.",

However, it is not tipping off to ask for further information as part of your normal CDD process. Permitted disclosures are allowed between institutions and within undertakings under ss.333B-333D.",

If consent is refused, the transaction must be halted for the moratorium period while the NCA investigates. If no response is received within 7 working days, consent is deemed to have been given.\n\nA \"prohibited act\" is an act mentioned in s.327(1) (concealing), s.328(1) (arrangements), or s.329(1) (acquisition/use/possession).",

If a person obtains a pecuniary advantage, he is taken to obtain a sum of money equal to the value of that advantage.\n\nIt is immaterial who carried out the criminal conduct, who benefited from it, or whether the conduct occurred before or after the passing of the Act.",

    "content": "Scottish Sectoral Risk Assessment: Key Findings (February 2022)\n\nThe Law Society of Scotland is the Professional Body AML Supervisor for Scottish solicitors. Of the 1,250 practices regulated by the Society, approximately 696 currently operate within the scope of the Money Laundering Regulations.\n\nSupervised Population Risk Profile (2020/21): 280 practice units at inherently lower risk; 362 at medium inherent risk; 54 at inherently higher risk — based on business activities, client types, and geographical reach.\n\nSerious Organised Crime in Scotland:\n- Approximately 2,400 individuals involved in Serious Organised Crime (SOC) in Scotland across 112 SOC Groups\n- 72% of SOCGs are located in the West of Scotland, 18% in the East, 10% in the North\n- SOC costs the Scottish economy approximately £2 billion per year\n- 72% of SOCGs are involved in the use of seemingly legitimate businesses (licensed premises, taxis, restaurants, shops, garages, property development, care homes, waste/recycling)\n- 69% of SOCGs are involved in drug crime (heroin most common, followed by cocaine, cannabis)\n- Other crime types: fraud (including tax fraud), human trafficking, acquisitive crime, environmental crime, cybercrime\n\nUK Context:\n- Over 70,000 individuals involved in SOC throughout the UK\n- £12 billion criminal cash generated annually in UK\n- Total estimated social and economic cost of SOC: at least £24 billion per year\n- Scale of money laundering impacting the UK: hundreds of billions of pounds annually\n\nPractices must use this document to inform their Regulation 18 Practice-Wide Risk Assessment (PWRA). The AML Certificate process focuses on inherent exposure to higher-risk clients, conveyancing, trust and company provision, geographic and delivery channel risk.",

The MLRO may adjust scoring or override thresholds in exceptional circumstances, with documented justification.\n\nAll risk scores must be calculated using the approved Internal Risk Scoring Model (currently version 3.7).
