5.6.2 Geographic Risk 
 
Geographic risk refers to the countries or geographic areas in which your business operates, 
receives funds from or where clients reside. It may also extend to considering any social, 
cultural or language ties which might increase a link to a known high risk jurisdiction country 
or geographic area. 
In assessing this risk at PWRA level, you may want to consider the following questions: 
 
• Does the practice operate outside of the UK/EU or equivalent jurisdictions 
(i.e., those where AML regulation may not be comparable) and/or in areas 
with potentially higher levels of corruption? 
• Does the practice receive funds from jurisdictions outside the UK/EU or 
equivalent jurisdictions (i.e., those where AML regulation may not be 
comparable? 
• Does the practice have a specific client-base, niche or undertake work for 
clients from outside of the UK/EU or equivalent jurisdictions (i.e., those where 
AML regulation may not be comparable)? 
 
5.6.2.1 Higher Risk Jurisdictions 
 
 R33(3)(a) defines high-risk third countries (HRTCs) as those which appear on the following 
lists maintained by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF): 
• Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring 
• High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action. 
These lists are set out here. 

42 
 
 
You will need to make sure that you stay up to date with these lists. Any amendments will be 
made in February, June or October each year at the conclusion of a FATF plenary session. 
You can check and diarise the exact dates on FATF’s events calendar. LSAG members may 
also alert their regulated populations to changes.  
The Regulations mandate prescriptive steps where your client is established in a HRTC or in 
relation to any relevant transaction, as defined at R33(3)(b), where either of the parties to the 
transaction is established in a HRTC. Please see Section 6 for more on this.  
You should note that there may be other jurisdictions that present a high risk of money 
laundering that are not on this list. 
 
Resources to help you consider whether a country is high risk include:  
• FATF and HM Treasury statements on unsatisfactory money laundering controls in 
overseas jurisdictions; 
• Transparency International's corruption perception index;   
• The Basel AML Index; 
• CIA World Factbook; 
• U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports (INSCR); 
• FATF Jurisdictional Information; and 
• The Know Your Country rating table. 
 
FATF in particular provides a source of valuable information on the relative risks associated 
with particular jurisdictions in its system of mutual evaluations, which provide an in-depth 
description and analysis of each country’s system for preventing criminal abuse of the 
financial system. It also produces a list of jurisdictions with ‘strategic deficiencies’ in their 
money laundering initiatives and a list of jurisdictions with 'low capacity', the latter being 
countries which have economic or sociological constraints preventing them from 
implementing AML/CTF measures effectively. 
 
In addition, information is publicly available regarding countries that present bribery and 
corruption risks and those regarded as secrecy jurisdictions or jurisdictions that permit the 
use of nominee shareholders.  
 
The consolidated sanctions list, also details the countries in which sanctioned individuals 
and organisations are based, which may also provide an indication of the relative risk of 
each jurisdiction.  
 
You should list all of the countries to which your practice is exposed in your PWRA and give 
a risk rating to each one. Being exposed to a country includes offering services, facilitating a 
matter involving or having clients established in that country. 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, prohibiting clients from outside of the UK or that are not UK-
nationals, is not a requirement of the Regulations. Geographic risk is primarily associated 
with jurisdiction, which may or may not extend to a client that has exposure to that 
jurisdiction, depending on the circumstances.  
 
It is important to consider the levels of exposure your practice and any clients may have to 
higher risk jurisdictions. For example, a practice that has a significant proportion of its 
business connected to or in association with a country of higher risk, may have a greater risk 
exposure than a practice that only has one client, who uses only some ancillary services 
from that same jurisdiction. Practices should consider this along with the relative risks posed 

43 
 
 
by the legal services offered to clients from such jurisdictions. On the other hand, experience 
of working in a high-risk jurisdiction can help practices to identify risks, while those with only 
a minor exposure may lack such experience and may struggle to correctly identify risks. 
 
Increasing globalisation means the likelihood that the work you do will involve other 
jurisdictions and the international dimension may not always be obvious. You should bear 
this in mind when assessing geographic risks and whether a client or matter may involve a 
higher risk jurisdiction. 
 
Country risk factors should feature prominently in a practice-wide risk assessment. Key 
issues to consider are whether the jurisdictions in which your clients, or the beneficial 
owners of your clients, are based or operate their businesses. 
 
5.6.2.2 Indicators of lower risk: 
 
• has stable, strong and independent political and legal systems, with legally 
protected commitments to transparency, accountability and integrity across the 
key institutions of government; 
• has compulsory suspicious activity reporting requirements in the regulated 
sector; 
• money laundering is criminalised, on a wide basis (e.g., all-crimes approach or 
a specific list), and an effective sanctions regime is in place; or 
• the country has transparency of beneficial ownership disclosure requirements 
and an established financial intelligence unit. 
 
5.6.2.3 Indicators of higher risk: 
 
• has deficient anti-money laundering legislation, systems and practices and/or 
inadequate AML supervision; 
• has high levels of acquisitive crime or higher levels of corruption; 
• are a jurisdiction where the production of drugs, drug trafficking/trade, terrorism 
or corruption is prevalent; 
• are considered to be 'offshore financial centres' or tax havens; 
• permit nominee shareholders to appear on the share certificate or register of 
owners; or 
• local requirements around company structure or equivalent governance are 
unclear or otherwise make it challenging to understand the control structure of 
an entity. 
Where your clients or the beneficial owners of your clients are based or operate their 
business in low-risk jurisdictions this should also be reflected in the PWRA. 
 
It is also important to consider whether your practice is involved in multi-jurisdictional 
matters. Money launderers are commonly attracted to matters which move money or value 
across borders, in order to obscure ownership and frustrate investigations.  
If you do not have the ability or expertise to effectively assess the risk posed by a particular 
jurisdiction, you should consider whether it is appropriate to continue to act in relation to 
clients or matters associated to those jurisdictions.  Please note that jurisdictional risk is not 
an assessment of a client’s nationality. Not accepting business solely due to a client’s 

44 
 
 
nationality is unacceptable and may lead to charges of discrimination and/or create access 
to justice issues for your practice. 
 
It may also be necessary to consider risks posed by non-nations that for whatever reason 
may pose a different risk to the nation within which they sit, e.g., regional jurisdictions such 
as Darfur in Sudan.
