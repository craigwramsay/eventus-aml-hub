5.6.3 Product or Service Risks 
 
You should consider the following questions:  
 
• Does the practice offer any services which may attract a higher level of risk such as 
large volume/high value conveyancing, corporate acquisitions, tax mitigation 
strategies, work involving high-risk jurisdictions or the creation and/or management of 
specialist entities? 
• Does the practice have the necessary expertise and experience to undertake the 
work requested? 
• Does the practice undertake work which may be of lower AML risk (e.g., 
executorship, wills, litigation)? 
 
 
The National Risk Assessment highlights that independent legal professionals face the 
greatest potential risks in the following areas: 
• misuse of client accounts; 
• sale/purchase of real property; 
• creation of trusts, companies and charities; 
• management of trusts and companies; and 
• sham litigation. 
 
Consideration should be given to whether the practice undertakes work with exposure to 
these risks and this should be documented in your PWRA accordingly.  
 
Other factors to consider are the value, complexity and nature of work in these areas in the 
context of the client and/or the nature of the work that your practice normally undertakes.  
 
5.6.3.1 Sale/purchase of real property 
 
According to law enforcement authorities and the national risk assessment, the sale and 
purchase of real estate is a common method for disposing of or converting criminal 
proceeds. 
 
Real estate is generally an appreciating asset and the subsequent sale of the asset can 
provide an apparently legitimate reason for the existence of the funds. Property matters are 
an attractive method of laundering criminal proceeds because: 
• Property is often a high value asset – it offers the opportunity to legitimatise large 
amounts of money in one go; 
• The value of property generally appreciates – this is unusual for criminals who 
usually lose money when laundering; 

45 
 
 
• The nature of conveyancing means that matters/transactions often happen extremely 
quickly – and therefore it is easier to hide behind a complicated money trail which 
can be constructed very quickly, and the onward sale of a property can give the 
appearance of a legitimate income stream; 
• Property can be used to generate additional quasi-legitimate income streams e.g., 
rental; and 
• Property can be used by the money launderer or an associate as a residence.  
 
Transfers of real estate from one owner to another without the exchange of funds, may 
present an equal risk to the purchase of property. 
5.6.3.2 Client accounts and payments 
 
You should consider the risk that criminals may attempt to misuse your client account. 
Putting the proceeds of crime through your client account can give funds the appearance of 
legitimacy, as the subsequent transfer will show as having originated from a regulated legal 
practice. It will also help obscure the audit trail of funds whether the money is sent back to 
the client, on to a third party, or invested in some way. 
 
Introducing cash into the banking system can be part of the placement stage of money 
laundering. The risk of this occurring, along with the controls in place at the practice to 
prevent this happening, should form part of your PWRA. 
 
Generally speaking, you should avoid accepting cash payments to your client account in 
relation to transactions. If you do choose to accept these as a policy of your practice, it 
should be considered high risk within the PWRA particularly where large in size (e.g., above 
£1,000). At a client or matter level, you should establish Source of funds for any cash 
payments and treat the funds on a risk sensitive basis. There may be valid reasons for 
accepting cash into the client account (e.g., access to justice or in cases of domestic 
disputes) – reasons for accepting any cash payment should be clearly documented. 
 
5.6.3.3 Formation and management of trusts and companies  
 
Company and trust structures may be exploited by criminals who wish to retain control over 
criminally derived assets while creating impediments to law enforcement agencies in tracing 
the origin and ownership of assets. Criminals may ask legal professionals to create 
companies and trusts and/or to manage companies and trusts, to provide greater 
respectability and legitimacy to the entities and their activities. 
Your PWRA should consider the practice’s exposure to this type of work, and the risks 
involved– especially where the practice undertakes complex company or trust work for 
clients involving higher risk jurisdictions. This is particularly important where beneficial 
ownership or nature of business can be obscured or anonymised, or the use of nominees or 
bearer shares is permitted. 
 
Shell companies are corporate entities that do not have any business activities or assets. 
They may be used for legitimate purposes such as serving as a temporary transaction 
vehicle. However, they can also be an easy and inexpensive way to disguise beneficial 
ownership and the flow of illegitimate funds and so are attractive to criminals engaged in 
money laundering. You should consider it as high risk if a client engages your services only 
in connection with the routine aspects of forming an entity, without seeking further legal 
advice on the appropriateness of the corporate structure and related matters. In jurisdictions 
where members of the public may register companies themselves with the company registry, 

46 
 
 
the engagement of a legal professional to register the company (or to use the practice’s 
address) may indicate that the client is seeking to add the appearance of legitimacy to a 
company. 
 
5.6.3.4 Other Services 
 
Other services to consider in risk assessments are: 
• Services where legal professionals may represent or assure the client’s standing, 
reputation and credibility to third parties, without a commensurate knowledge of the 
client’s affairs; 
• Acquisitions of businesses in liquidation; and 
• Services offered to clients in the context of trade based or trade-finance 
arrangements. 
5.6.3.5 Risk of offering both in-scope and out-of-scope services 
 
Many practices have both an AML-compliant client onboarding (take-on) process and a 
separate process for those areas of activity outside the scope of the Regulations. This is 
permissible, but it does create a risk. 
 
The risk is that if a client is onboarded via an AML non-compliant process for out-of-scope 
work, and then transferred over to AML in-scope services, there is likely to be a need to 
apply further due diligence, in order to bring the original due diligence up to the required 
standard. 
 
To mitigate this risk practices may either have clear and robust PCPs in place to manage 
the transition or conduct full AML-compliant CDD regardless of the nature of the matter. 
This would enable a client to be transferred more easily between a practice’s out-of-scope 
and in-scope services. 
 
5.6.3.6 Dealing with payments credited to your client account without permission 
 
Legal professionals may receive funds that are either overpayments, or completely 
unasked for deposits. You should give consideration to the possibility that any unsolicited 
payment or unexpected overpayment may have been engineered for the purposes of 
money laundering and treat these instances appropriately (including consideration of the 
submission of a SAR as appropriate). A repayment of funds from a legal professional’s 
account may help to legitimise the proceeds of crime. 
 
Such instances should be recorded in an appropriate place, for example in a client or 
matter risk assessment, or in the records of the MLRO. 
 
One way to deal with such matters is to set an internal value threshold, beyond which, 
greater consideration must be given to whether the circumstances prompt suspicion and a 
subsequent disclosure to the NCA. Except in exceptional circumstances funds received in 
such a manner should only be returned to the source from which they were received.   
 

47 
 
 
R31(2) confirms that you are not prevented from repaying money deposited in your client 
account, provided that, if you have suspicion of money laundering, you obtain 
consent/DAML from NCA for the transaction. 
 
If you display your client account details freely, for example, on your letterhead or a 
website, the risk of them being abused by criminals is greatly increased. This is something 
you should avoid.

6.14.12 Trusts 
 
These obligations set out below, apply to all trusts including will trusts and personal injury 
trusts.  
 

76 
 
 
6.14.12.1 Who is the client? 
 
In the UK, trusts do not have legal personality. As such, a trust cannot be your client. 
When advising in relation to a trust, your client may be: 
 
• the settlor; 
• the trustee(s); 
• the protector(s); or 
• one or more of the beneficiaries. 
 
Your client(s) will be the person to whom you owe your duty of care and who will receive 
the benefit of your advice. 
 
Where an express trust has yet to be established and you are providing tax or 
transactional advice to a prospective settlor in anticipation of creating a trust, your client 
will usually be the settlor. Your responsibilities to verify the identity of the client and their 
source of funds, is then no different to any other client, except that you will also need to 
understand the nature and extent of the assets that will be settled on the trust. 
 
6.14.12.2 Specific CDD requirements when instructed in relation to an existing trust 
 
Where you are instructed in relation to an existing trust, when applying CDD: you must 
obtain and verify the identity of your client including beneficial owners where applicable: 
 
• where you act for several beneficiaries (subject to conflicts issues), you must 
obtain and verify the identity of each of them, unless you are acting for them as 
a class (in which case you should identify the class by its name); 
• you must, where your client has had a trust funding role, understand your client’s 
source of wealth and the source of funds which were contributed (or which were 
used to acquire assets which were contributed) to the trust; 
• you must understand the nature and extent of the assets settled on the trust; and 
• you must understand and record the identity of the (non-client) settlor, trustee(s), 
protector(s), and/or beneficiary(is) and any person who otherwise has control of 
the trust, as trust beneficial owners. 
 
If the trust is a relevant trust for registration, you must also identify potential 
beneficiaries. 
 
If, when you carried out CDD in relation to a trust (or legal entity/arrangement other 
than a body corporate) the beneficiaries were designated as a class you must 
establish and verify the identity of any beneficiary before you are involved in the 
payment to, or exercising of rights of, a specified beneficiary.  
 
When applying CDD to a trust, or any other legal arrangement/entity which is not a 
company, involving a class of beneficiaries, you must always verify the identity of the 
beneficiary or beneficiaries before any payment is made to them or they exercise their 
vested rights in the trust or legal entity/arrangement (R 30 (7)). 
 

77 
 
 
6.14.12.3 CDD where the identified client (i.e., the trustee or the settlor) of a trust is an entity  
 
If the identified beneficial owner is an entity, you may need to understand who its 
ultimate beneficial owners are, depending on the entity's status (e.g., whether it is a 
company or some other type of entity).  
 
The extent of the measures you take to identify the ultimate beneficial owner of one of the 
trust’s defined ‘beneficial owners’ will depend on its role in relation to the trust. The ultimate 
beneficial owner of a settlor, protector or sole beneficiary entity should be fully identified. 
 
6.14.12.4 Who is a ‘beneficiary’ for the purposes of CDD where you act in relation to trusts? 
 
R6(1) implies that individual beneficiaries need not be identified in CDD unless it has been 
determined that they will benefit from the trust. That is, unless and until they have a vested 
interest in the capital of the trust. 
 
If you do not note all individual beneficiaries named in the trust deed or any associated 
document on the basis that their benefit from the trust has not yet been determined, you 
must identify any named class of beneficiaries, by its description. For example: 
 
• grandchildren of [X]; or 
• charity [Y]. 
 
As CDD can only take account of circumstances at a point in time, you should note the 
names of all discretionary beneficiaries (including those who have yet to acquire determined 
interests) named in the trust deed and any document from the settlor relating to the trust, 
such as a letter of wishes. Their interests may vest (or otherwise be determined) while you 
are acting in relation to the trust, thus bringing them within the group of individuals who need 
to be noted in CDD as beneficiaries, as defined in R6(1)(c). 
 
When considering the identity of those in whose main interest a trust is set up or 
operates and there are several classes of beneficiary, consider which class is most 
likely to receive most of the trust property. For example: 
 
• where a trust is for the issue of [X], then the class is the issue of [X] as there is only 
one class; 
• where a trust is for the children of [X], if they all die, for the grandchildren of [X] 
and if they all die for charity [Y], then the class is likely to be the children of [X] as 
it is unlikely that they will all die before the funds are disbursed; or 
• where a discretionary trust allows for payments to the widow, the children, their 
spouses and civil partners, the grandchildren and their spouses and civil partners 
then all interests are equal, and all classes will need to be identified. 
 
When in doubt about which class has the main interest, you should identity all 
classes. 
 
However, where you act in relation to a discretionary trust, if you decide against noting in 
your CDD the names of individual beneficiaries who are named in the trust deed or any 
associated document on the basis that their benefitting from the trust has not yet been 
determined, you will need to seek regular updates from your client, as part of your on-going 

78 
 
 
monitoring measures on a risk-based approach. This may include when and whether 
beneficiaries’ interests in the trust will be or have been determined. 
 
The wider approach, involving noting all beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries named 
in the trust deed and any associated document at CDD outset, may therefore be 
preferable from the outset. 
6.14.12.5 What does ‘an individual who has control over the trust’ mean? 
R6(1)(e) brings any individual who has control over the trust within the definition of 
the beneficial owners of a trust and they will therefore need to be identified when you 
act in relation to a trust. 
 
R6(2) defines control as a power, whether exercisable alone, jointly or with the consent of 
another, under the trust instrument or by law to: 
 
• dispose of, advance, lend, invest, pay or apply trust property; 
• vary or terminate the trust; 
• add or remove a person as a beneficiary or to or from a class of beneficiaries; 
• appoint or remove trustees or give another individual control over the trust; or 
• direct, withhold consent to or veto the exercise of one of the above powers. 
 
R6(4)(b) specifically excludes from the definition of an individual who has control over a 
trust an individual ('P') who has control solely as a result of: 
 
• P's consent being required in accordance with section 32(1)(c) (power of 
advancement) of the Trustee Act 1925; 
• any discretion delegated to P under section 34 (power of investment and 
delegation) of the Pensions Act 1995; 
• the power to give a direction conferred on P by section 19(2) (appointment and 
retirement of trustee at instance of beneficiaries) of the Trusts of Land and 
Appointment of Trustees Act 1996; or 
• the power exercisable collectively at common law to vary or extinguish a trust 
where the beneficiaries under the trust are of full age and capacity and (taken 
together) absolutely entitled to the property subject to the trust (or, in Scotland, 
have a full and unqualified right to the fee). 
 
6.14.12.6 CDD implications arising from the register of beneficial owners of taxable relevant trusts 
 
If you or your practice on occasions acts as (as opposed to for) a trustee of a taxable 
relevant trust, pursuant to R44 of the Regulations you will need to maintain accurate and 
up to date records of all beneficial owners and potential beneficiaries of the trust. 
 
Even if your practice is also acting for the trustee(s) and has applied CDD, this may involve 
you in more extensive investigations. 
 
A taxable relevant trust is: 
 
• a UK express trust, meaning that either all the trustees are resident in the UK or 
at least one trustee is UK resident and the settlor was UK resident and domiciled 
when the trust was set up or when the settlor added funds to it; or 

79 
 
 
• any other (non-UK) express trust which, in any tax year, becomes liable to pay 
one or more of UK income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land 
tax, land and buildings transaction tax or stamp duty reserve tax in relation to UK 
income or assets. 
 
If you form a business relationship in your role as trustee with a relevant person, which 
could be an advisory relationship with your practice (if it is subject to the Regulations), 
you will need to inform the relevant person that you are acting as a trustee and, on 
request, provide the relevant person with information identifying the trust’s beneficial 
owners and potential beneficiaries. 
 
That obligation lies on (external) trustees of relevant trusts who enter into transactions in 
relation to which you or your practice are required to apply CDD or who form a business 
relationship with you or your practice (if you are subject to the Regulations). This should 
assist you in your compliance with your CDD obligations and is another reason why it 
makes sense to extend your CDD in relation to a relevant trust's beneficial owners also to 
cover potential beneficiaries. 
 
Otherwise, from a reputational risk and advisory perspective, as law enforcement 
authorities may gain access to information not only about the trust’s beneficial owners as 
defined in R6(1) but also the names of those individuals who are referred to in any 
document from the settlor, such as a letter of wishes, relating to the trust, it is prudent to 
note such wider information in your CDD records where you act for any client in relation to 
a relevant trust, and where you act in relation to any trust. 
6.14.12.7 Practical considerations of CDD for trusts 
 
Applying CDD where you act in relation to an existing trust should generally involve your 
having sight of the trust deed or documents which relates to it and obtaining an 
appropriate understanding of their content. In some circumstances, this understanding of 
the content may come from an explanatory note provided by another professional 
regulated for AML to a similar standard. The rationale for obtaining such evidence in this 
manner should be documented. 
 
In low-risk situations (as determined by appropriate and thorough documented risk 
assessment) you may be able to record an account of the terms of the trust given by the 
client or another regulated person who has had an involvement with setting up or 
managing the trust. However, before doing so, you should be assured that the reason for 
your not being provided with the trust deed and any document which relates to it makes 
sense in all circumstances, is recorded by you and is not indicative of a higher risk of 
money laundering. 
 
You will also need to assure yourself that in identifying the trust’s beneficial owners, the 
client or other regulated person, as appropriate, had proper regard to whether they 
included any individual (other than the settlor, the trustees and the beneficiaries) who has 
control over the trust, and potential beneficiaries. 
 
6.14.13 Partnerships, limited partnerships, Scottish limited partnerships and UK LLPs 
A partnership, other than in Scotland, is not a separate legal entity, so you must 
obtain information on the constituent individuals. 

80 
 
 
 
Where partnerships or unincorporated businesses are well-known, reputable organisations, 
with long histories in their industries and with substantial public information about them, their 
principals, and controllers the following information may be sufficient: 
 
• name; 
• registered address, if any; 
• trading address; and 
• nature of business. 
 
You must still verify the identity of the partnership’s beneficial owners. 
 
R5(3) provides that in the case of a partnership (but not a limited liability partnership) 
the following individuals are beneficial owners: 
 
• any individual ultimately entitled to or who controls, (whether directly or 
indirectly), more than 25 per cent of the capital or profits of the partnership or 
more than 25 per cent of the voting rights in the partnership; or 
• any individual who otherwise exercises control over the management of the 
partnership. 
 
Relevant points to consider when applying R5(3) are: 
 
• the property of the entity includes its capital and its profits; and 
• control involves the ability to manage the use of funds or transactions outside of 
the normal management structure and control mechanisms 
 
You should also consider whether there are any other registries on which you may be able 
to verify the details of the partnership.  
 
Other partnerships and unincorporated businesses which are small and have few partners 
should be treated for identification and verification purposes in the same way as private 
individuals (i.e., identifying and verifying each partner). Where the numbers are larger, 
they should be treated for identification and verification purposes in the same way as 
private companies. 
 
Where a partnership is made up of regulated professionals, it may be sufficient to confirm 
the practice's existence and the trading address from a reputable professional directory or 
search facility with the relevant professional body. Otherwise, you should obtain evidence 
on the identity of at least two partners and evidence of the practice's trading address. You 
must still verify the identity of the partnership’s beneficial owners. 
 
For a UK LLP or SLP, you should obtain information in accordance with the requirements 
for companies as outlined above as these are treated as corporate entities. 
 
Careful consideration should be made regarding clients where partners themselves are 
overseas entities, particularly where these overseas entities are located in jurisdictions 
where no publicly available corporate registers are available, or ownership can be 
otherwise concealed through the use of nominees or similar structures. This is particularly 
relevant where the vehicle is used to hold assets or is involved in transactional or other 
potentially high-risk activities, or conversely, where no discernible business activity can be 
determined, from internet searches or other sources. Such factors may be indicative of 
shell companies and are likely to be indicative of higher ML risk. You should give 

81 
 
 
consideration to why the use of such structures may not be legitimate and the nature and 
purpose of the business. Your client may be able to help you understand this. Information 
obtained should be considered in light of other CDD information available.  
 
Where you have assessed the client risk to be higher risk because of its structure or 
factors as above, then you must put in place enhanced due diligence and ongoing 
monitoring.

6.14.14 Foundations 
 
Foundations may or may not have legal personality. You should investigate whether this 
is the case and whether it is appropriate to take on the foundation as your client or 
whether your client should be the board of trustees or another party involved with the 
foundation. 
 
If the foundation lacks legal personality, you should approach CDD, as you would where 
you act for a client in relation to a trust. R6(5) provides that ‘beneficial owner’ in relation to 
a foundation or other legal arrangement similar to a trust, means those individuals who 
hold equivalent or similar positions to the (defined) beneficial owners of trusts.
