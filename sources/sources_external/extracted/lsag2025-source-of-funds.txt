6.17 Source of Funds and Source of Wealth 
 
6.17.1 Overview 
A fundamental element of client due diligence is understanding the nature, background and 
circumstances of the client, including their financial position – and making an assessment as 
to whether the legal services provided to the client are in keeping with your understanding of 
that background and circumstances. 
 
The extent to which you must obtain, review and evidence your client’s financial position is 
dependent upon the risk profile of the client or matter. In enhanced due diligence situations 
this requirement is more stringent. 
 
The financial circumstances of a client can broadly be categorised into Source of Funds 
(SoF), and Source of Wealth (SoW). 
 
A practice must scrutinise transactions on a matter-by-matter basis, with the objective of 
understanding what the source of funds are for transactions you undertake on behalf of a 
client. This is a fundamental aspect of holistic CDD. It is important to remember that 
understanding the SoF and SoW is a key protection for your practice, and it should be 
approached as an opportunity to protect your practice from being used for money 
laundering. 
 
The type of documentation accepted to verify SoW or SoF should depend on the level of 
ML/TF risk presented by the customer. The higher the risk, the more comprehensive and 
reliable documents you obtain should be. 
 
Taking a risk-based approach, you may consider funds remitted from a legal practice 
regulated for AML to equivalent standards as the Regulations as being of lower risk. 
 
You must take adequate measures to check SoF and SoW as a part of EDD when applied 
to PEPs. You should also consider doing so as a part of ongoing monitoring of any business 
relationship (whether high risk or otherwise). You should also apply a source of wealth 
check in other applications of EDD on a risk-based approach.  
 
It is good practice to check the SoF even if a business relationship as defined in the 
Regulations has not been formed, and the matter is an occasional transaction. It should be 
considered that checking source of funds is a useful practical tool for protecting your 
practice generally. 
 
It is important to document the source of funds checks conducted on each client or matter – 
this may be by way of the collation of information/evidence obtained, and/or the inclusion of 
a file note outlining what checks were undertaken, what evidence obtained, and the 
conclusions derived from these checks. 
 
SoF and SoW do not mean the same thing, although there can be significant overlap 
between the two and they do not exist in isolation to each other.

6.17.2 Source of Funds 
Source of Funds 
Source of Funds refers to the funds that are being used to fund the specific transaction 
in hand – i.e., the origin of the funds used for the transactions or activities that occur 
within the business relationship or occasional transaction.  The question you are 
seeking to answer should not simply be, “where did the money for the transaction 
come from,” but also “how and from where did the client get the money for this 
transaction or business relationship.” It is not enough to know the money came from a 
UK bank account. 
 
For further reference see point 87 in the following FATF guidance here.  
 
6.17.2.1 Establishing Source of Funds: 
 
The types of data and documents that you use for verification of Source of Funds will vary 
depending on the circumstances and the information that the customer provides to you. 
 
The SoF pertains directly to the funds that are being used to fund the specific transaction in 
hand i.e., the origin of the funds used for the transactions or activities that occur within the 
client’s business relationship with you. Checking this means ascertaining where those funds 
came from, how they were accumulated by the client and ensuring on a risk-based approach 
that they are not the proceeds of crime. 
 
SoF is not simply  limited to knowing from which financial institution the funds in question 
may have been transferred, except where the financial institution is providing financing for 
the transaction e.g., via mortgage. It should also not be limited to checking that the client’s 
name matches the name on the account. 
In addition to documenting the 
• Amount; 
• Currency, and 
• The remitting account details (bank, account number, sort code, name on account)- 
-the information obtained should be substantive and establish a provenance or reason for 
having been acquired e.g., salary, gift etc.  
 
Acquiring bank statements, Wills, full payslips, audited financial accounts showing funds 
disbursed to the client, sales/purchase agreements, receipts of other transactions or similar 
documentation may all be useful in establishing source of funds. Establishing income from 
share capital, business activities, a bequest of gift etc. can also help you. 
 
 
In circumstances where it becomes known that a third party is to contribute to funds for a 
transaction, you should consider also seeking to understand and obtain evidence relating to 
the third party’s underlying SoF, in the same way you would on the client themselves, with 
the extent of such measures increasing with risk level. Whether and the extent to which you 
should obtain, review and evidence third party SoF is dependent upon the risk profile of the 
client or matter, bearing in mind that accepting payments from unknown or unassociated 
third parties is a specific risk factor pursuant to 33(6)(b)(iv).  

91 
 
 
 
The need for and extent of source of funds checks should be informed by your ongoing 
assessment of client and matter risk under regulations 28(11) to (13), and in turn inform 
future assessments. You must also bear in mind your obligation under regulation 28(16) to 
demonstrate that the measures you have taken to carry out due diligence are appropriate, 
with reference to both your PWRA and the relevant sectoral risk assessment. 
 
It may be difficult to determine the SoF without some understanding of the underlying SoW 
of the individual. This can particularly be the case where the funds for a transaction have 
become mixed with other funds in an account. Here, to understand the SoF, you may need 
to have an awareness of the underlying SoW, although your level of confidence in the SoW 
in such a case, should be considered on a risk-based approach (see  6.17.3 and 6.18.3 for 
further guidance on SoW. 
 
6.17.3 Source of Wealth 
 
Source of Wealth 
 
The source of wealth refers to the origin of a client’s entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets).  
 
SoW describes the economic, business and/or commercial activities that generated, or 
significantly contributed to, the client’s overall net worth/entire body of wealth. This should 
recognise that the composition of wealth generating activities may change over time, as 
new activities are identified, and additional wealth is accumulated. 
 
You should seek to answer the question: “why and how does the individual have the amount 
of overall assets they do – and how did they accumulate/generate these?” 
 
For further reference see point 88 in the following FATF guidance here.  
 
 
 
SoW is a holistic appraisal as to where an individual or an entity has derived their overall 
wealth (i.e., the origin of their entire body of assets), rather than any specific portion of it. 
To check SoW in a low/medium risk transaction, you may be comfortable identifying the SoW 
by asking and recording how the client has accrued their wealth or by verifying the client’s 
business interests through public searches. For low/medium risk transactions in relation to 
companies and other body corporate clients you could be comfortable that the intended 
transaction is consistent with what you know about the company. For guidance in establishing 
SoW in higher risk situations see 6.18.3. 
 
For further information on source of wealth requirements please see the Enhanced Due 
Diligence section below.
