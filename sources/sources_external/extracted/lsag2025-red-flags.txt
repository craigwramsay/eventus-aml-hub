# LSAG AML Guidance 2025 - Red Flags and Suspicious Activity Indicators
# Chapter 18 (Sections 18.1 - 18.10)
# Source: lsag-aml-guidance-23-april-2025.pdf

18.1 General Overview 
 
The Regulations require you to conduct risk assessments, due diligence and ongoing 
monitoring of your business relationships and take steps to be aware of transactions with 
heightened money laundering or counter-terrorist financing risks. The Proceeds of Crime Act 
2002 requires you to report suspicious transactions. 
 
This section highlights a number of warning signs or “red flags” for legal professionals 
generally and for those dealing with particular types of work, to further help you assess the 
AML risks associated with your practice, or risks of a particular client or matter appropriately 
and also to help you decide whether you have reasons for concern or the basis for a 
reportable suspicion.  
 
Because money launderers are always developing new techniques, no list of examples can 
be exhaustive or fully comprehensive; however, below are some key factors which may arise 
during or after client and retainer acceptance and give you cause for concern.  
 
If you become aware of a red flag, this should prompt to you to ask for additional 
documentation or ask further questions of your client.  For any aspect of an instruction, good 
questions to ask are, “Does this make sense?” and, “Is the documentation I have consistent 
with what I am being told and know about the background, nature or circumstances of the 
client?”  If the answer is no, then consider what further information or documentation you 
require in order to become satisfied. If you cannot be satisfied, you consider your position in 
terms of proceeding with the relationship or matter, as per r.30., and consider the 
submission of a suspicious activity report.  
 
The presence of any one red flag does not mean that a client is automatically high risk, that 
you should not continue with the retainer or that you need to make a Suspicious Activity 
Report. The presence of red flags must be considered in context; the client may be able to 
provide a legitimate explanation.  For example, a large transaction by an oil company points 
to high risk, but actually it may be a normal and regular occurrence for that particular client’s 
industry and business activities, and for your law firm.  Remember, it is not “tipping off” to 
ask for further information as part of your client due diligence process.  
 
If you cannot get the information you need, this may in itself be cause for further concern 
and lead you to become suspicious. 
 
18.2 Examples of Red Flags 
 
In collating these red flags, reference has been made to The FATF Report on Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Vulnerabilities of Legal Professionals (2013) and The 
FATF Guidance on Concealment of Beneficial Ownership (July 2018) as well as other, 
similar pieces of guidance.

transaction or their representative;  
• the natural person acting as a director or representative does not appear to be a

18.3 The Nature of the Transaction 
 
• Transactions involving jurisdictions with strict bank secrecy and confidentiality rules, 
without similar money laundering requirements; 
• use of shell companies which may be indicated by: 
o formal nominees and informal nominees, such as children, spouses, relatives or

avoid the attention of a trustee in a bankruptcy case, HMRC, or a law enforcement 
agency;  
• transactions which appear to be complex or unusually large;  
• unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic purpose; 
• transactions are unusual because of their size, nature, frequency or manner of 
execution;

• involvement of structures with multiple countries where there is no apparent link to 
the client or transaction; 
• incorporation and/or purchase of stock or securities of several companies, 
enterprises or legal entities within a short period of time with elements in common;

transactions, or company activities; 
• there are several elements in common between a number of transactions in a short 
period of time; 
• back-to-back property transactions (for example, within six months), with rapidly 
increasing value or purchase price;  
• abortive transactions with no concern for the fee level or after receipt of funds;  
• the retainer exclusively relates to keeping documents or other goods, holding large 
deposits of money or otherwise using the client account; 
• a lack of sensible commercial/financial/tax or legal reason for the transaction;  
• a power of attorney is sought for the administration or disposal of assets under 
conditions which are unusual; 
• investment in immovable property, in the absence of any links with the place where 
the property is located and/or of any financial advantage from the investment;   
• services where legal professionals, effectively acting as financial intermediaries, 
handle the receipt and transmission of funds through accounts they control in the act 
of facilitating a business transaction;  
• services that allow clients to deposit/transfer funds through the legal professional’s 
trust account that are not tied to a transaction which the legal professional is 
performing;  
• services where the client may request financial transactions to occur outside of the 
legal professional’s trust account;  
• services requested by the client for which the legal professional does not have 
expertise unless the legal professional is referring the request to an appropriately 
trained professional for advice; 
• services that rely heavily on new technologies that may have inherent vulnerabilities 
to exploitation by criminals, especially those not regulated for AML/CFT;  
• transfer of real estate or other high value goods or assets between parties in a time 
period that is unusually short for similar transactions with no apparent legal, tax, 
business, economic or other legitimate reason;  
• payments received from un-associated or unknown third parties and payments in 
cash where this would not be a typical method of payment; 
• transactions where it is readily apparent to the legal professional that there is 
inadequate consideration, especially where the client does not provide legitimate 
reasons for the amount of the consideration; 

208 
 
 
• administrative arrangements concerning estates where the deceased was known to 
the legal professional as being a person who had been convicted of crimes that 
generated proceeds;  
• unexplained establishment of unusual provisions in credit arrangements that do not 
reflect the commercial position between the parties;  
• transfer of goods that are inherently difficult to value, where this is not common for 
the type of client, transaction or the legal professional’s normal course of business; 
• acquisitions of businesses in liquidation with no apparent legal, tax, business, 
economic or other legitimate reason;  
• services where the legal professional acts as a trustee/director that allows the client’s 
identity to remain anonymous; or 
• commercial, private or real property transactions or services to be carried out by the 
client with no apparent legitimate business, economic, tax, family governance, or 
legal reasons.  
18.4 Trusts and Administration of Estates 
 
• Purpose of the trust is unclear (trusts can be used to evade tax and hide criminal 
property); 
• unusual structure or jurisdiction;  
• unexplained use of express trusts, and/or incongruous or unexplained relationships 
between beneficiaries and the settlor; 
• settlor was accused or convicted of acquisitive criminal conduct, improperly claimed 
welfare benefits or had evaded the due payment of tax during their lifetime; 
• assets earned or obtained in a high-risk jurisdiction; 
• unexplained or incongruous classes of beneficiaries in a trust; or 
• discrepancy between the supposed wealth of the settlor and the object of the 
settlement.  
18.5 Property work  
 
18.5.1 Ownership issues 
 
• Properties owned by nominee companies or multiple owners may be used as money 
laundering vehicles to disguise the true owner and/or confuse the audit trail; or 
• sudden or unexplained changes in ownership. (Flipping, involves a property 
purchase, often using someone else’s identity which is then quickly sold for a much 
higher price to the same buyer using another identity. The proceeds of crime are 
mixed with mortgage funds for the purchase. This process may be repeated several 
times.) 
18.5.2 Funding Methods 
 
• Transactions that do not involve a mortgage have a higher risk of being fraudulent, 
though a payment being made through the mainstream banking system is not 
guaranteed to be clean;  
• large payments from private funds, especially if your client has a low income and 
payments from a number of individuals or sources;  
• funds are supplied by a third party; or 
• checks on the source of the funding can be more difficult where they involve direct 
payments between buyers and sellers. 

209 
 
 
18.5.3 Valuing 
 
• A significant discrepancy between the sale price and what would reasonably be 
expected for such a property to sell for.  
18.5.4 Lender issues 
  
• A client may attempt to mislead a lender client to improperly inflate a mortgage 
advance – for example, by misrepresenting the borrower’s income or because the 
seller and buyer are conspiring to overstate the sale price.  This is mortgage fraud, 
and the mortgage advance will be the proceeds of crime; or 
• loans which are not at arms’ length may require particularly close consideration.  
 
18.5.5 Tax issues 
  
• If the purchase price is recorded incorrectly, this may be in an attempt to evade 
stamp duty (the saving would represent the proceeds of crime.) 
 
18.5.6 Charities 
 
• If registered with the Charity Commission, a charity is likely to be lower risk; 
• if you are asked to receive money on the charity's behalf from an individual or a 
company donor, or a bequest from an estate, be alert to unusual circumstances 
including large sums of money; or 
• there is growing concern about the use of charities for terrorist funding. HM Treasury 
maintains a consolidated list of individuals and entities to whom you may not provide 
funds, economic resources, and in relation to terrorism, financial services.  
18.6 Company and Commercial Work   
 
18.6.1 Formation of private equity funds  
 
• Generally private equity work will be considered at low risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing. Factors which may alter this risk assessment include:   
 
o where the private equity sponsor or an investor is located in a jurisdiction which is 
not regulated for money laundering to a standard which is equivalent to the 4th 
Directive;  
o where the investor is either an individual or an investment vehicle itself; or 
o where the private equity sponsor is seeking to raise funds for the first time.  
 
• Whether an unregulated private entity firm, fund manager or other person involved 
with the transaction is an appropriate source of information regarding beneficial 
ownership of the client should be determined on a risk-based approach. Issues to 
consider include: 
 
o the profile of the private equity sponsor, fund manager, or such other person;  
o their track record within the private equity sector; or 
o their willingness to explain identification procedures and provide confirmation that 
all beneficial ownerships have been identified.  

210 
 
 
18.6.2 Collective investment schemes 
 
The risk associated with a collective investment scheme may be decreased where:   
• the scheme is only open to tax-exempt institutional investors;  
• investment managers are regulated individuals or entities; or 
• a prospectus is issued to invite investment.  
 
Factors which will increase the risks include where:   
• the scheme is open to non-tax-exempt investors;  
• the scheme or its investors are located in a jurisdiction which is not regulated for 
money laundering to a standard which is not equivalent to the currently applicable EU 
directive; or 
• neither the scheme nor the investment managers are regulated and do not conduct 
CDD on the investors.  
18.7 Trust and Company Service Providers (TCSPs) 
 
• Payments received from un-associated or unknown third parties and payments for 
fees in cash where this would not be a typical method of payment;  
• inexplicable changes in ownership;  
• activities of the trust, company or other legal entity are unclear or different from the 
stated purposes under trust deeds or internal regulations of the company or 
foundation;  
• legal structure has been altered frequently and/or without adequate explanation; 
• management of any trustee, company or legal entity appears to be according to 
instructions of unknown or inappropriate person(s); 
• unlikely choice of TCSP without a clear explanation, given the size, location or 
specialisation of the TCSP; 
• use of pooled client accounts or safe custody of client money / assets or bearer 
shares, without justification; 
• situations where advice on the setting up of legal persons or legal arrangements may 
be misused to obscure ownership or real economic purpose;  
• in case of an express trust, an unexplained nature or classes of beneficiaries and 
acting trustees of such a trust; 
• services where TCSPs may in practice represent or assure the client’s standing, 
reputation and credibility to third parties, without a commensurate knowledge of the 
client’s affairs;  
• services that are capable of concealing beneficial ownership from competent 
authorities;  
• services that have deliberately provided, or depend upon, more anonymity in relation 
to the client’s identity or regarding other participants than is normal;  
• use of virtual assets and other anonymous means of payment and wealth transfer 
within the transaction without apparent legal, tax, business, economic or other 
legitimate reason; 
• transactions using unusual means of payment; 
• postponement of a payment for an asset or service delivered immediately to a date 
far from the moment at which payment would normally be expected to occur, without 
appropriate assurances that payment will be made;  
• successive capital or other contributions in a short period of time to the same 
company with no apparent legal, tax, business, economic or other legitimate reason;  

211 
 
 
• power of representation given in unusual conditions and the stated reasons for these 
conditions are unclear or illogical;  
• transactions involving closely connected persons and for which the client and/or its 
financial advisors provide inconsistent or irrational explanations and are 
subsequently unwilling or unable to explain by reference to legal, tax, business, 
economic or other legitimate reason;  
• nominee is being used with no apparent legal, tax, business, economic or other 
legitimate reason;  
• commercial, private or real property transactions or services to be carried out by the 
trust, company or other legal entity with no apparent legitimate business, economic, 
tax, family governance, or legal reasons;  
• products/services that have inherently provided more anonymity or confidentiality 
without a legitimate purpose; 
• existence of suspicion of fraudulent transactions, or transactions that are improperly 
accounted for;  
• any attempt by the settlor, trustee, company or other legal entity to enter into any 
fraudulent transaction;  
• any attempt by the settlor, trustee, company or other legal entity to enter into any 
arrangement to fraudulently evade tax in any relevant jurisdiction;  
• The customer is both the ordering and beneficiary customer for multiple outgoing 
international funds transfers;  
• The connections between the parties are questionable, or generate doubts that 
cannot be sufficiently explained by the client; 
• The transaction itself: 
o is occurring between two or more parties that are connected without an apparent 
business or trade rationale; 
o is a business transaction that involves family members of one or more of the 
parties without a legitimate business rationale; 
o is a repeat transaction between parties over a contracted period of time; 
o is a large or repeat transaction, and the executing customer is a signatory to the 
account, but is not listed as having a controlling interest in the company or 
assets; 
o is executed from a business account but appears to fund personal purchases, 
including the purchase of assets or recreational activities that are inconsistent 
with the company’s profile; 
o as executed from a business account and involves a large sum of cash, either as 
a deposit or withdrawal, which is anomalous, or inconsistent with the company’s 
profile;  
o appears cyclical; 
o involves the two-way transfer of funds between a client and a professional 
intermediary for similar sums of money; 
o involves two legal persons with similar or identical directors, shareholders or 
beneficial owners;

o involves complicated transaction routings without sufficient explanation or trade

o loan or mortgage is paid off ahead of schedule, incurring a loss;

• Unexplained use of powers of attorney or other delegation processes.  
 
18.8 Litigation (generally out of scope but still may be relevant for POCA or TACT) 
 
• Disputes which are settled too easily or in an atypical manner may indicate sham 
litigation; 
• payments on account followed by request for refund; or 
• settlement of a debt by credit card, which may be stolen. 
18.9 Choice of Lawyer 
 
• The instructions are unusual for your practice or client or where they change 
unexpectedly without a logical reason; 
• the client has changed advisor a number of times or engaged multiple legal advisers 
without legitimate reason;  
• the required service was refused by another professional or the relationship with 
another professional was terminated; 
• effusive praise for you or your firm; or 
• willingness to pay more than usual rates.  
18.10 Proliferation Financing 
 
• Transaction involves person or entity in foreign country of proliferation concern.  
• Transaction involves person or entity in foreign country of diversion concern.  
• The customer or counter-party or its address is similar to one of the parties found on 
publicly available lists of “denied persons” or has a history of export control 
contraventions.

match end-user’s business profile. 
• A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product’s final destination. 
• Order for goods is placed by firms or persons from foreign countries other than the 
country of the stated end-user. 
• Transaction involves shipment of goods incompatible with the technical level of the 
country to which it is being shipped, (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
being shipped to a country that has no electronics industry). 
• Transaction involves possible shell companies (e.g. companies do not have a high 
level of capitalisation or displays other shell company indicators).  
• Transaction demonstrates links between representatives of companies exchanging 
goods i.e. same owners or management.  
• Circuitous route of shipment (if available) and/or circuitous route of financial

• Transaction involves persons or companies (particularly trading companies) located 
in countries with weak export control laws or weak enforcement of export control 
laws. 
• Transaction involves shipment of goods inconsistent with normal geographic trade 
patterns (e.g. does the country involved normally export/import good involved?).  
• Transaction involves financial institutions with known deficiencies in AML/CFT 
controls and/or domiciled in countries with weak export control laws or weak 
enforcement of export control laws.  
• Based on the documentation obtained in the transaction, the declared value of the

Annex I 
If you suspect that property involved in a retainer is criminal property, offences under section 327 and section 329 are relatively straightforward to 
assess. However, an arrangement offence under section 328 may be more complicated, particularly with transactional matters. 
Annexes II and III 
You may become concerned in the arrangement by, for example, executing or implementing it, which may lead you to commit an offence under 
the Proceeds of Crime Act or the Terrorism Act (2000). 
Consider whether you need to make an authorised disclosure to: 
• obtain consent/DAML to proceed with the transaction 
• provide yourself with a defence to the principal money laundering offences 
If you are acting within the regulated sector, consider whether you risk committing a failure to disclose offence, if you do not make a disclosure to 
the NCA. 
The following two flowcharts show the issues to consider when deciding whether to make a disclosure to the NCA.
