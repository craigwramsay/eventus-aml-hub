Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring — 24 October 2025

Jurisdictions under increased monitoring are actively working with the FATF to address strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring.

The FATF and FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) continue to work with the jurisdictions below as they report on the progress achieved in addressing their strategic deficiencies. The FATF calls on these jurisdictions to complete their action plans expeditiously and within the agreed timeframes. The FATF does not call for the application of enhanced due diligence measures to be applied to these jurisdictions, but encourages its members and all jurisdictions to take into account the information presented below in their risk analysis.

The FATF identifies the following countries:

Jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies (as at 24 October 2025):

Algeria
Angola

Bulgaria
Cameroon
Côte d'Ivoire

Jurisdictions no longer subject to increased monitoring (removed October 2025):

These four jurisdictions are no longer subject to the FATF's increased monitoring process after substantially completing their action plans, including by having addressed or making significant progress in addressing the key recommended actions in their mutual evaluation reports.
