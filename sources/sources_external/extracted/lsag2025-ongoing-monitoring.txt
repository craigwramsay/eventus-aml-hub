6.21 Ongoing Monitoring 
R28(11) requires that you conduct ongoing monitoring of business relationships.  
Ongoing monitoring is defined as: 
• scrutiny of transactions undertaken throughout the course of the relationship, 
(including where necessary, the source of funds), to ensure that the 
transactions are consistent with your knowledge of the client, their business and 
their risk profile; and 
• undertaking reviews of existing records and keeping the documents, or 
information obtained for the purpose of applying CDD, up to date. 
You must also be aware of obligations to keep clients' personal data updated under the 
Data Protection Act 1998 and the GDPR or their equivalent. 
In order to comply, you may: 

103 
 
 
• renew and re-evaluate CDD at appropriate intervals (including during the course 
of a given transaction), noting that as outlined in R27(8), this is mandatory in 
certain circumstances;  
• suspend or terminate a business relationship until you have updated information 
or documents, though this may be excessive if you are satisfied you know who 
your client is, and keep under review any request you have made for 
information or documents; or 
• use technology to aid your ongoing monitoring. 
You should operate a system of regular review and renewal of CDD and take a risk-based 
approach to such activity. You should consider reviewing (although not necessarily redoing) 
the CDD upon each new matter. Where there has been a significant gap between 
instructions (anything above a year may be considered a significant gap in relation to those 
clients or transactions assessed as higher-risk), you should consider refreshing the CDD.  
You must update the CDD when you become aware of any changes to the client’s 
identification information. This would include change of name, address, beneficial owner or 
business. 
In accordance with R27(9) you must apply (or reapply) CDD to existing clients on a risk-
based approach and when you become aware that the circumstances of the existing client 
have changed. 
 
In determining this, you must consider: 
 
• any indication that the identity of the client, or beneficial owner has changed; 
• any transactions which are not reasonably consistent with your knowledge of the 
client; 
• any change in the purpose or nature of the relationship; and 
• any other matter which may affect your assessment of the money laundering or 
terrorist financing risk in relation to the client. 
 
It may also be necessary to undertake ongoing monitoring through the course of a single 
matter – particularly where there is an element of duration to the matter, and parties to the 
matter, or the SoW/SoF involved may have changed. 
 
Each time a practice engages in ongoing monitoring (which may or may not include full 
reverification) it should record: 
 
• what aspects of the issue they considered; 
• action taken (if any); 
• the reasons for that decision; and 
• who undertook the monitoring and the date on which it was undertaken?  
 
Bear in mind also that the Regulations as amended prescribe further situations where you 
must re-apply CDD for existing clients – these being when a practice has any legal duty in 
the course of the calendar year to contact a client under the International Tax Compliance 
Regulations 2015 or to review information: 
• relevant to their client risk assessment (or where appropriate practice-wide/matter 
risk assessment as appropriate); and 

104 
 
 
• concerning beneficial ownership information of the customer, including information 
which helps them understand the ownership or control structure of any entity that is 
the beneficial owner of the client.
