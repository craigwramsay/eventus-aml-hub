6.18 Enhanced Due Diligence 
 
R33 provides that you must apply enhanced due diligence (EDD) and enhanced ongoing 
monitoring in addition to the CDD measures required in R28, where: 
• the case has been identified as one where there is a high risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing in your risk assessment or in the information made available to you 
by your supervisor under R17(9) and R47; 
• you carry out an occasional transaction and either party to the transaction is 
established in a high-risk third country; 
• the client is a politically exposed person (PEP), or a family member or known close 
associate of a PEP; 
• the client is established in a high-risk third country; 
• the client has provided false or stolen identification documentation or information on 
establishing the relationship and you have decided to continue dealing with the client; 
• there is any other situation which you have assessed as presenting a higher risk of 
money laundering or terrorist financing; or 
• wherever the transaction: 
o is complex 
o unusually large 
o there is an unusual pattern of transactions, or 
o the transaction or transactions have no apparent economic or legal purpose. 
6.18.1 Enhanced Due Diligence and the Beneficial Ownership Threshold 
 
In high-risk situations warranting the application of enhanced due diligence, it may be 
appropriate to examine beneficial owners with  25% ownership if you have concerns 
regarding the ownership structure or feel that the ownership structure is a pertinent risk 
factor, to fully understand control and ownership interests in the client. 
 
6.18.2 What is EDD? 
 
The Regulations specify that you must take measures to examine the background and 
purpose of the transaction and to increase the monitoring of the business relationship 
where enhanced due diligence is required. The Regulations are not prescriptive about 
exactly what must be included in EDD, with the exception of clients that are PEPs. 
 
As per R33(5), EDD may include (while not being restricted to): 
o seeking additional independent, reliable sources to verify information provided or 
made available to you; 
o taking additional measures to understand better the background, ownership and 
financial situation of the customer, and other parties to the transaction; 
o taking further steps to be satisfied that the transaction is consistent with the purpose 
and intended nature of the business relationship; or 
o increasing the monitoring of the business relationship, including greater scrutiny of 
transactions. 
In the case of a High Risk Third Country (HRTC), EDD is more restrictive. 
 
If you are establishing a business relationship with a client in a HRTC, you will need to 
apply the EDD including the steps below. You will also need to apply the steps below when 

93 
 
 
either your client or the counterparty is established in a HRTC where you are undertaking 
an occasional transaction (within the meanings of R27(1)(b) and (2)). 
 
In these circumstances, EDD must include: 
o obtaining additional information on the client and on the client’s beneficial owner; 
o obtaining additional information on the intended nature of the business relationship; 
o obtaining information on the source of funds and the source of wealth of the client 
and the client’s beneficial owner; 
o obtaining information on the reasons for the transactions; 
o obtaining the approval of senior management for establishing or continuing the 
business relationship; and 
o conducting enhanced monitoring of the business relationship including increasing the 
frequency and number of checks or other controls applied; and selecting patterns of 
transactions that trigger a requirement of further explanation to your practice.  
If a client with whom you have a business relationship (not in a HRTC) is engaging in a 
transaction where the counterparty is based in a HRTC, you should consider the risks this 
presents and whether it is appropriate to apply EDD to the transaction. 
 
You should also consider whether it is appropriate to go beyond the above minimum 
requirements, particularly in circumstances of higher risk or where you have identified red 
flags. This may include for example seeking greater verification of the client’s identity, 
background and circumstances from independent and reliable information sources. It may 
also mean lowering beneficial ownership thresholds to 25% or less or conducting further 
screening or adverse media searches on directors or beneficial owners of the client. 
 
6.18.3 Establishing source of wealth 
(Please also see 16.7.3) 
An important additional EDD measure should include understanding the financial situation of 
the client – in practice this means taking additional measures to understand the SoW as well 
as the SoF of the client.  
  
You should consider the level and nature of verification required in light of the risks posed by 
the client, transaction and/or business relationship. 
 
As part of your EDD process you should verify the SoW with evidence obtained from the client 
and/or independent sources until you are comfortable that you understand where the client's  
overall wealth has been derived from and (to the best of your knowledge) that it is legitimate. 
You should document your rationale in a file note. 
When addressing SoW, you should consider whether the SoW is commensurate to your client 
in general i.e., does it make sense that the client in front of you obtained their wealth in the 
way that they have advised you? 
 
The SoW refers to the origin of a client’s entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets). This 
information will usually give an indication as to the volume of wealth the client would be 
expected to have, and a picture of how the person acquired such wealth. 
 
It does not however require you to account for all of a client’s assets, but to build a rationale 
and reasoning as to why they have such wealth and to provide assurance that it was 

94 
 
 
obtained through legal means. This will help you to establish whether the transaction makes 
sense. 
 
In many complex scenarios it may be difficult to determine original sources of wealth, 
possibly accrued many years ago. In such scenarios, reasonable efforts must be 
undertaken to obtain relevant information from the client, and this must be reviewed in light 
of other risk factors, such as jurisdictional/geographic risk, adverse media, PEP status and 
transaction type (especially transactions which may help obscure the ownership or transfer 
of assets). 
 
Although a practice may not have specific information about assets not deposited or 
processed by them, it may be possible to gather general information from commercial 
databases or other open sources. 
 
Where the client’s SoW is not readily apparent, the first step in establishing either SoF 
or SoW is asking questions of your client and where appropriate seeking independent 
verification and corroboration of information across a variety of sources, to build a 
picture of the client’s background and circumstance which may require asking questions 
of the client. 
 
Actions taken, documentation and materials reviewed, and decisions taken (including 
rationale) must be clearly recorded. These may be reviewed at a later date by your 
supervisor or other relevant authorities. 
 
Where you cannot successfully establish the SoW in higher risk situations, you should 
consider ceasing to act for the client and whether you need to submit a report to the 
NCA. 
6.18.4 Enhanced monitoring 
Enhanced ongoing monitoring is automatically required whenever EDD is applied. 
 
One aspect of keeping transactions under review is to ensure they are still in line with the 
CDD information held on the client, and information contained in the client and matter risk 
assessments. Whatever controls you have in place to monitor other business 
relationships, may be intensified in order to apply enhanced monitoring.  
 
This may include: 
• requiring a greater level of information and explanation from the client when 
activity diverts from that addressed in their client risk assessment;  
• greater frequency of checks on transactions, particularly SoF; or 
• undertaking more frequent due diligence checks on your client. 
You should ensure that funds paid into your client account come from an expected source 
and are for an amount commensurate with the client's known wealth and with what is 
expected to be deposited in relation to the matters on which you act for them.

6.19 When to apply EDD 
 
6.19.1 High-risk third countries 
 
You must apply EDD measures in any business relationship with a person established 
in a HRTC or where you are undertaking an occasional transaction (within the meanings 
of R27(1)(b) and (2)) where either party is established in a high-risk third country.  
 
HRTCs are defined by the Regulations as High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for 
Action or Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring by FATF.   
 
Being “established in” a country means: 
• in the case of a legal person, being incorporated in or having a principal place 
of business (head office) in that country, or for a financial institution having its 
main regulator in that country; or 
• in the case of a natural person, being resident in that country but not 
necessarily simply having been born in that country. 
However, this requirement does not apply if: 
 
• the client is a branch or majority owned subsidiary of an entity which is a third 
country and the entity is subject to requirements equivalent to the 5
th
 Money 
Laundering Directive and supervised for compliance with those requirements; 
• it complies with the group wide policies established by the entity under Article 45 
of the Directive, and 
• you do not consider EDD measures to be necessary taking a risk-based 
approach. 
 
Note that not all countries where there may be a higher risk of money laundering are 'high-
risk third countries' for these purposes. Other jurisdictions may equally pose higher ML 
risks – these should be assessed as part of client and matter risk assessments, and 
additional, enhanced due diligence measures should be applied accordingly. 
 
6.19.2 Other situations of higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing 
 
Enhanced due diligence is also required where there is a higher risk of money laundering 
or terrorist financing. In determining whether there is a higher risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing in a given case, you must consider the risk factors set out in R33(6), 
along with the outcomes of your practice-wide, client and matter risk assessments.  
 
Instances of high risk as detailed in your supervisor’s risk assessment and in the National 
Risk Assessment also require EDD to be applied. 
 
Please see the features outlined in Section 5 and 18 of this guidance for further 
information. You should consider the situation in context of the CDD information held on 
your client, including their background and financial circumstances. 
 
 
Regulation 33(6) – Risk Factors you must consider when determining whether to 
apply EDD 

96 
 
 
 
When assessing whether there is a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing in 
a particular situation, and the extent of the measures which should be taken to manage 
and mitigate that risk, relevant persons must take account of risk factors including, 
among other things—  
 
(a)customer risk factors, including whether—  
(i) the business relationship is conducted in unusual circumstances;  
(ii) the customer is resident in a geographic area of high risk (see sub-paragraph (c));  
(iii) the customer is a legal person or legal arrangement that is a vehicle for holding 
personal assets;  
(iv) the customer is a company that has nominee shareholders or shares in bearer form;  
(v) the customer is a business that is cash intensive;  
(vi) the corporate structure of the customer is unusual or excessively complex given the 
nature of the company’s business;  
(vii) the customer is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy; o 
(viii) the customer is a third country national who is applying for residence rights in or 
citizenship of an EEA state in exchange for transfers of capital, purchase of a property, 
government bonds or investment in corporate entities in that EEA state; 
 
(b)product, service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors, including whether—  
(i) the product involves private banking;  
(ii) the product or transaction is one which might favour anonymity;  
(iii) the situation involves non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, without 
certain safeguards, such as an electronic identification process which meets the 
conditions set out in regulation 28(19);  
(iv) payments will be received from unknown or un-associated third parties;  
(v) new products and new business practices are involved, including new delivery 
mechanisms, and the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-
existing products;  
(vi) the service involves the provision of nominee directors, nominee shareholders or 
shadow directors, or the formation of companies in a third country;  
(vii) there is a transaction related to oil, arms, precious metals, tobacco products, cultural 
artefacts, ivory or other items related to protected species, or other items of 
archaeological, historical, cultural or religious significance or of rare scientific value 
 
(c) geographic risk factors, including—  
(i) countries identified by credible sources, such as FATF mutual evaluations, detailed 
assessment reports or published follow-up reports, as not having effective systems to 
counter money laundering or terrorist financing;  
(ii) countries identified by credible sources as having significant levels of corruption or 
other criminal activity, such as terrorism (within the meaning of section 1 of the Terrorism 
Act 2000(86)), money laundering, and the production and supply of illicit drugs;  
(iii) countries subject to sanctions, embargos or similar measures issued by, for example, 
the European Union or the United Nations;  
(iv) countries providing funding or support for terrorism;  
(v) countries that have organisations operating within their territory which have been 
designated—  
(aa) by the government of the United Kingdom as proscribed organisations under 
Schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000(87), or  
(bb) by other countries, international organisations or the European Union as terrorist 
organisations; and 
(vi) countries identified by credible sources, such as evaluations, detailed assessment 
reports or published follow-up reports published by the Financial Action Task Force, the 

97 
 
 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development or other international bodies or non-governmental 
organisations as not implementing requirements to counter money laundering and 
terrorist financing that are consistent with the recommendations published by the 
Financial Action Task Force in February 2012 and updated in June 2019. 
 
As well as considering the risks identified above, you should have regard to any of the risk 
factors discussed in Section 5 that may be present in a given client or matter.  
 
6.19.3 Screening, Due Diligence & Other Control Measures - Politically-Exposed Persons 
 
Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) present risks as they have the opportunity to use 
their political position to enrich themselves through corrupt activities. In order to treat 
PEPs in a risk-based way, it is a precondition that you can correctly identify them.  
6.19.3.1 Who is a PEP? 
 
A PEP is a person who has been entrusted within the last year (or for a longer period if 
you consider it appropriate to address the risks in relation to that person) with one of the 
following prominent public functions by a public institution, an international body, or a 
state, including the UK. 
 
Listing of PEP roles R35(14) 
• heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant 
ministers; 
• members of parliament or similar legislative bodies; 
• members of governing bodies of political parties; 
• members of supreme courts, of constitutional courts, or any judicial body 
whose decisions are not subject to further appeal, except in exceptional 
circumstances; 
• members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks; 
• ambassadors, charges d'affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces; 
• members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of 
state-owned enterprises; or 
• directors, deputy directors and members of the board of equivalent function of 
an international organisation. 
 
In addition to the primary PEPs listed above, a PEP also includes (R35(12)): 
• family members of a PEP – spouse, civil partner, children, their spouses or 
partners, and parents; and 
• known close associates of a PEP – persons with whom joint beneficial 
ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement is held, with whom there are 
close business relationships, or who is a sole beneficial owner of a legal entity 
or arrangement set up by the primary PEP. 
 
 
Middle ranking and junior officials are not PEPs. In the UK, only those who hold truly 
prominent positions should be treated as PEPs and the definition should not be applied to 
local government, more junior members of the civil service or military officials other than 

98 
 
 
those holding the most senior ranks. This should be borne in mind as many commercially 
available PEP checking tools may have a much lower threshold for considering an 
individual a PEP. 
 
In the Government consultation on 5MLD, it was strongly suggested that the FCA’s 
guidance on PEPs should be the standard across the board.  
 
Section FCA guidance sets out the FCA’s view of what categories of person should be 
treated as PEPs in the UK (building on the above). 
 
6.19.3.2 Identifying a PEP 
 
R35(1) requires you to have appropriate risk management systems and procedures to 
determine whether a client or beneficial owner is a PEP. 
 
Practices must take a risk-based approach to identifying PEPs. 
 
To assess your risk of encountering a PEP, you must consider your PWRA, the level of 
risk of money laundering or terrorist financing inherent in your business and the extent 
to which that risk would be increased by a business relationship with a PEP. 
 
In larger or more specialist practices where it may be reasonably expected to undertake 
work on behalf of PEPs in the normal or regular course of business, frequency and 
intensity of PEP screening should be increased (potentially using an established 
commercial provider), both at the outset of the matter and an ongoing basis. Many 
practices use services that can run checks against PEP databases which they maintain.  
 
Where you have a higher risk of having PEPs as clients or you have reason to suspect that 
a person may actually be a PEP contrary to earlier information, you should consider 
conducting some form of electronic verification.  
 
The range of PEPs is wide and constantly changing, so any EID&V will not give you total 
certainty. You should have reference to Section 7 when considering the possible 
confidence you may place in the abilities of any EID&V tool. 
 
Regardless of the result of any single check you should consider the wider possibility that 
your client is a PEP. 
 
Questions you should ask with regard to PEP Status 
• What role(s) does the individual hold? 
• What is the nature and context of business relationship?  
• What services or products does the PEP wish to use?  
• What is the potential for the product to be misused for the purposes of 
corruption? 
• Do you know if they have close family members or known associates and if so, 
what roles do they hold? 
• What level of public scrutiny, exposure, governance, disclosures or accountability 
in their role is the PEP subject to? 
• Are their accompanying geographic risks associated with the PEP relationship? 
• If you have identified a PEP, were they helpful in providing this information and if 
not, should and how would this impact my assessment of the risk present? 

99 
 
 
• Does the nature of their PEP status impact in the level of EDD that needs to be 
applied, and if so, how? 
 
In practices where undertaking work on behalf of PEPs is unlikely or a very rare 
occurrence, it may be acceptable to use publicly available or open sources. Checking for 
PEP status should be undertaken on a risk-based approach, in light of other CDD 
information held (such as employment) which may lead to the practice suspecting PEP 
status.  
 
Simple measures may include: 
• asking the client or their representative (as appropriate) whether the person is a 
PEP, as a part of client onboarding; 
• performing an internet search in order to check whether the individual may hold 
any position that qualifies them as a PEP; or 
• reviewing the information, they submit to you carefully to determine whether any 
information you have access to, suggests they may be a PEP. 
 
 
Other indicators that may indicate your client is a PEP include: 
 
• receiving funds from a government account; 
• correspondence on official letterhead from the client or a related person; 
• information from the client or person related to the matter linking the client to a PEP; 
and 
• any information which comes to your attention suggesting your client is actually 
a PEP or linked to one. 
 
Where you suspect a client is a PEP but cannot establish that for certain, you should 
consider what steps you could take in order to resolve this uncertainty. If you are not able to 
resolve the issue to your satisfaction, you may consider (on a risk-based approach) 
applying aspects of enhanced due diligence procedures (as a lack of clarity as to whether 
a person is a PEP could, in and of itself, be indicative of a heightened risk of money 
laundering). 
 
It is worth reiterating from the outset that family members of PEPs, and known close 
associates of PEPs, must be treated as PEPs in terms of the due diligence you apply.   
You should apply the same standard of investigation when identifying whether someone is 
a family member of a PEP, as you do for a PEP. 
 
R35(15) sets out a different process for “known close associates.” 
 
“For the purpose of deciding whether a person is a known close associate of a politically 
exposed person, a relevant person need only have regard to information which is in its 
possession, or to credible information which is publicly available.” This means that you are 
only expected to be able to identify a known close associate where the information you 
already hold tells you that this is what they are, or if it is publicly available. 
 
6.19.3.3 Mitigation of PEP Risk 
 
In deciding what risk mitigation to apply you must (R35(2)) take account of: 

100 
 
 
• your PWRA; 
• the client or matter risk assessment; and 
• any information published by your supervisor. 
PEPs may pose a higher risk, by virtue of having a greater potential opportunity to be 
involved in corruption, due to the positions or access to public funds they hold. Being a 
PEP should not, preclude access to legal services, provided the practice undertakes the 
necessary enhanced due diligence measures. 
 
Since 10 January 2024 the regulations state that in relation to domestic PEPs, that is, 
those entrusted with prominent public functions by the United Kingdom: 
• the starting point for the assessment is that the client or potential client presents a 
lower level of risk than a non-domestic PEP, and 
• if no enhanced risk factors are present, the extent of EDD measures to be applied 
in relation to that client or potential client is less than the extent to be applied in the 
case of a non-domestic PEP. 
When there is a PEP relationship (including where a PEP is a beneficial owner of a 
client and where a client or its beneficial owner is a family member or known close 
associate of a PEP), the Regulations specify that you must take the following steps to 
deal with the heightened risk: 
 
• have senior management approval for establishing a business relationship 
with a PEP or an entity beneficially owned by a PEP; 
• take adequate measures to establish the SoF and SoW which are involved in the 
business relationship or occasional transaction; 
• conduct closer ongoing monitoring of the business relationship; and 
• consider which aspects of your EDD protocol are appropriate for the PEP in 
question. 
 
Where you have a beneficial owner who you know to be a PEP, you should consider on a 
risk-based approach what extra EDD measures, you need to take when dealing with that 
client. 
 
Where the client is a state-owned entity and the PEP in question is only a PEP due to 
their position in the State-Owned Entity, you may consider whether this mitigates the risks 
present. 
 
A useful source of further information is the FCA's guidance on the treatment of politically 
exposed persons for anti-money laundering purposes. The guidance is aimed at practices 
supervised by the FCA, but you should take it into account in accordance with 
R35(4)(b)(i). 
 
6.19.3.4 Senior management approval for onboarding a PEP 
 
R3(1) defines 'senior management' as: 
 
An  officer  or  employee  of  the  relevant  person  with sufficient  knowledge  of  the  relevant 
person's money laundering and terrorist financing risk exposure, and of sufficient authority to 
take decisions affecting its risk exposure. 
 

101 
 
 
The FCA guidance referred to above sets out their view as to who, for the purposes of the 
Regulations, should be treated as coming within the definition of senior management. 
 
For legal practices, senior management may be: 
• a member of the board of directors or equivalent senior management team; 
• the head of a practice group or department or function; 
• a senior or managing partner; or 
• the MLRO or, if different, the MLCO. 
 
Other individuals may fall into this category depending on the nature and structure of your 
practice. 
 
Senior Management may delegate the application of their roles to other suitably senior 
and competent individuals however they remain ultimately responsible and accountable. 
You should advise those responsible for monitoring risk assessments that a business 
relationship with a PEP has begun, to help their overall monitoring of the practice's risk 
profile and compliance. 
 
For sole practitioners, you should appropriately record your decision e.g., as a conclusion 
to the client or matter risk assessment.
