Annex I 
If you suspect that property involved in a retainer is criminal property, offences under section 327 and section 329 are relatively straightforward to 
assess. However, an arrangement offence under section 328 may be more complicated, particularly with transactional matters. 
Annexes II and III 
You may become concerned in the arrangement by, for example, executing or implementing it, which may lead you to commit an offence under 
the Proceeds of Crime Act or the Terrorism Act (2000). 
Consider whether you need to make an authorised disclosure to: 
• obtain consent/DAML to proceed with the transaction 
• provide yourself with a defence to the principal money laundering offences 
If you are acting within the regulated sector, consider whether you risk committing a failure to disclose offence, if you do not make a disclosure to 
the NCA. 
The following two flowcharts show the issues to consider when deciding whether to make a disclosure to the NCA.
