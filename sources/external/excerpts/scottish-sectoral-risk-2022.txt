Law Society of Scotland AML/CTF Sectoral Risk Assessment 
 
Assessment of international and domestic risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting Scottish 
solicitors February 2022 
 
Introduction, Background & Purpose: 
 
Under Regulation 17 of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) 
Regulations 2017, the Law Society of Scotland must identify and assess the international and domestic risks of money 
laundering to which its members are subject. 
 
Where appropriate, the supervisory authority should make this assessment available to its supervised population, where this 
might assist relevant persons in undertaking their own money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment. 
 
In carrying out such a risk assessment supervisors should consider various reports and guidelines issued by authorities such 
as the European Supervisory Authorities, HM Treasury and Home Office. The supervisory authority must also keep an up-to-
date record in writing of the steps it has taken under r.17 
 
We have therefore identified the below publications as important points of reference for identifying and assessing the 
AML/CTF risks to which Scottish solicitors are subject: 
 
• HM Treasury/Home Office UK National Risk Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (NRA) 
(December 2020)  
• Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – Money Laundering Vulnerabilities of Legal Professionals (2013) (link) 
• Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach - Guidance for Legal Professionals (June 2019) 
• European Supra-National AML/CTF Risk Assessment Report 2019  
• National Crime Agency – National Strategic Assessment of Serious & Organised Crime 2021  
• Scottish Government Serious & Organised Crime in Scotland: A Summary of Evidence (2017)  
• Scottish Government Serious & Organised Crime Progress Report (2020) 
 
 
Who should use this sectoral risk assessment/who is it aimed at? 
 
This risk assessment is primarily intended to be used by Scottish solicitors and legal practices who are supervised for AML 
purposes by the Law Society of Scotland 
 
What should Practices do with this information? 
 
A core principle of AML compliance is taking a risk-based approach (RBA).  
 
In short, an RBA refers to adjusting the level and type of compliance work done (frequency, intensity and/or amount), to the 
risks present. In order to apply a RBA, it is necessary then to have information on the risks inherent to your practice and in 
any particular client or matter – and the pertinence of these risks - which is why robust risk assessments are so important.  
 
If you have not fully assessed the risks present across your business or in any particular client or matter, you cannot then 
apply appropriate controls to mitigate those risks adequately and effectively.  
 
The resulting benefits of this approach include:  
 
• More efficient and effective use of resources, proportionate to the risks faced.  
• Minimising compliance costs and administrative burdens on practices and clients; and  
• Greater flexibility to respond to emerging risks as money laundering and terrorist financing methods change. 
 
Fundamental to this is the undertaking and embedding of a Practice-Wide Risk Assessment (PWRA) into your business, as 
prescribed under r.18 of the Money Laundering Regulations. 
 
PWRAs should be comprehensive in identifying and assessing all the money laundering and terrorist financing risks your 
practice faces. The PWRA is central and fundamental to the AML controls implemented across your business and needs to 
address certain issues, prescribed by the Regulations. 
 
Further information regarding PWRA’s can be found in s.5 of the UK Legal Sector Affinity Group (LSAG) Guidance 
 
This document (along with other resources on our website including the UK Legal Sector AML Guidance) is aimed at 
providing information to Scottish solicitors to support in the implementation of robust, risk-based and proportionate 
AML measures. 
 
As per r.18(2a) the information contained in this document must be used to inform your r.18 Practice-Wide Risk 
Assessment (PWRA) 
 

 
 
Scottish Legal Sectoral Overview: Key Demographics & Stats: 
The Law Society of Scotland is the Professional Body AML Supervisor for Scottish solicitors.  Of the 1250 practices regulated 
by the Law Society of Scotland, c. 696 currently operate within the scope of the MLRs.  
 
Our AML Certificate Process 
The Society’s AML Certificate is an annual compulsory questionnaire issued to in-
scope practice  units,  consisting  of  c.  50  questions  relating  to  inherent  AML  risk 
factors. In line with the MLRs and the UK National Risk Assessment, it focuses on a 
practice’s inherent exposure to higher risk clients and areas of practice such as 
conveyancing,  trust  and  company  provision,  along  with  geographic  and  delivery 
channel risk.  
Once  analysed,  the  data  collected  is  used  to  build  a  risk  profile  of  our  supervised 
population, and can also allow us to  
understand specific risks, trends, or issues across individual practices.  
This profiling mechanism allows the Society to satisfy requirements of r.46 – i.e., to 
adopt a risk-based approach by basing the frequency and intensity of our supervision 
according to the risk profile of our supervised population.  
The  Society  also  sets  out  our  approach  to  risk-based  supervision  and  associated 
outcomes in a Risk Appetite Statement published in February 2021 
 
 
Through the analysis of our 2020/21 AML Certificate returns, we have built a risk 
profile of our in-scope supervised population – we believe that 280 practice units 
represent an inherently lower risk of handling the proceeds of crime, 362 are at 
medium inherent risk and 54 pose an inherently higher risk given the type of 
business activities they undertake, the types of clients they hold and their 
geographical reach. 
It is important to note that the risks described in this document may affect all in-
scope Practices (to a greater or lesser extent) no matter what their risk profile is. 
 
The analysis of AML certificate information also gives us the ability to identify 
specific risks within our supervised population and has been used to inform this 
sectoral risk assessment. 
 
 
Snapshot: The Nature and Scale of Serious Organised Crime (SOC), and Associated Money Laundering
 
 
UK: 
• >70,000 individuals involved in SOC throughout the UK 
• £12bn criminal cash generated annually in UK. 
• The total estimated social and economic cost of SOC each year to the UK is at least £24 billion 
• Scale of ML impacting on the UK hundreds of billions of pounds annually. 
Scotland: 
• c. 2,400 individuals involved in SOC in Scotland 
• 112 SOC Groups 
• 72% of SOCGs are located in the West of Scotland, 18% in the East and 10% in the North.  
• In Scotland, it is estimated that SOC costs the Scottish economy alone (i.e., excluding the social cost) £2 billion per year. 
• 72% of SOCGs are involved in the use of seemingly legitimate businesses. The most common business types are 
licensed premises, taxis, restaurants, shops, garage repairs and vehicle maintenance, property development, care 
homes, waste/recycling. 
 
Predicate Crime: 
Money Laundering is not victimless – it is a serious crime which underpins almost all criminal activity, and the 
effects are felt across Society, and in each and every local community across Scotland: 
 
• 69% of SOCGs are involved in drug crime; heroin is the most popular commodity, followed by cocaine, cannabis, 
amphetamine, and tranquilisers.  
• Other crime types include violence; money laundering; various forms of fraud including cigarette smuggling, counterfeiting 
and tax fraud; human trafficking; acquisitive crime such as vehicle and metal theft; environmental crime such as illegal 
dumping of hazardous materials and cybercrime. 
• Human trafficking (including female and child se
