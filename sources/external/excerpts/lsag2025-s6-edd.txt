6.18 Enhanced Due Diligence 
 
R33 provides that you must apply enhanced due diligence (EDD) and enhanced ongoing 
monitoring in addition to the CDD measures required in R28, where: 
• the case has been identified as one where there is a high risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing in your risk assessment or in the information made available to you 
by your supervisor under R17(9) and R47; 
• you carry out an occasional transaction and either party to the transaction is 
established in a high-risk third country; 
• the client is a politically exposed person (PEP), or a family member or known close 
associate of a PEP; 
• the client is established in a high-risk third country; 
• the client has provided false or stolen identification documentation or information on 
establishing the relationship and you have decided to continue dealing with the client; 
• there is any other situation which you have assessed as presenting a higher risk of 
money laundering or terrorist financing; or 
• wherever the transaction: 
o is complex 
o unusually large 
o there is an unusual pattern of transactions, or 
o the transaction or transactions have no apparent economic or legal purpose. 
6.18.1 Enhanced Due Diligence and the Beneficial Ownership Threshold 
 
In high-risk situations warranting the application of enhanced due diligence, it may be 
appropriate to examine beneficial owners with  25% ownership if you have concerns 
regarding the ownership structure or feel that the ownership structure is a pertinent risk 
factor, to fully understand control and ownership interests in the client. 
 
6.18.2 What is EDD? 
 
The Regulations specify that you must take measures to examine the background and 
purpose of the transaction and to increase the monitoring of the business relationship 
where enhanced due diligence is required. The Regulations are not prescriptive about 
exactly what must be included in EDD, with the exception of clients that are PEPs. 
 
As per R33(5), EDD may include (while not being restricted to): 
o seeking additional independent, reliable sources to verify information provided or 
made available to you; 
o taking additional measures to understand better the background, ownership and 
financial situation of the customer, and other parties to the transaction; 
o taking further steps to be satisfied that the transaction is consistent with the purpose 
and intended nature of the business relationship; or 
o increasing the monitoring of the business relationship, including greater scrutiny of 
transactions. 
In the case of a High Risk Third Country (HRTC), EDD is more restrictive. 
 
If you are establishing a business relationship with a client in a HRTC, you will need to 
apply the EDD including the steps below. You will also need to apply the steps below when 

 
 
either your client or the counterparty is established in a HRTC where you are undertaking 
an occasional transaction (within the meanings of R27(1)(b) and (2)). 
 
In these circumstances, EDD must include: 
o obtaining additional information on the client and on the client’s beneficial owner; 
o obtaining additional information on the intended nature of the business relationship; 
o obtaining information on the source of funds and the source of wealth of the client 
and the client’s beneficial owner; 
o obtaining information on the reasons for the transactions; 
o obtaining the approval of senior management for establishing or continuing the 
business relationship; and 
o conducting enhanced monitoring of the business relationship including increasing the 
frequency and number of checks or other controls applied; and selecting patterns of 
transactions that trigger a requirement of further explanation to your practice.  
If a client with whom you have a business relationship (not in a HRTC) is engaging in a 
transaction where the counterparty is based in a HRTC, you should consider the risks this 
presents and whether it is appropriate to apply EDD to the transaction. 
 
You should also consider whether it is appropriate to go beyond the above minimum 
requirements, particularly in circumstances of higher risk or where you have identified red 
flags. This may include for example seeking greater verification of the client’s identity, 
background and circumstances from independent and reliable information sources. It may 
also mean lowering beneficial ownership thresholds to 25% or less or conducting further 
screening or adverse media searches on directors or beneficial owners of the client. 
 
6.18.3 Establishing source of wealth 
(Please also see 16.7.3) 
An important additional EDD measure should include understanding the financial situation of 
the client – in practice this means taking additional measures to understand the SoW as well 
as the SoF of the client.  
  
You should consider the level and nature of verification required in light of the risks posed by 
the client, transaction and/or business relationship. 
 
As part of your EDD process you should verify the SoW with evidence obtained from the client 
and/or independent sources until you are comfortable that you understand where the client's  
overall wealth has been derived from and (to the best of your knowledge) that it is legitimate. 
You should document your rationale in a file note. 
When addressing SoW, you should consider whether the SoW is commensurate to your client 
in general i.e., does it make sense that the client in front of you obtained their wealth in the 
way that they have advised you? 
 
The SoW refers to the origin of a client’s entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets). This 
information will usually give an indication as to the volume of wealth the client would be 
expected to have, and a picture of how the person acquired such wealth. 
 
It does not however require you to account for all of a client’s assets, but to build a rationale 
and reasoning as to why they have such wealth and to provide assurance that it was 

 
 
obtained through legal means. This will help you to establish whether the transaction makes 
sense. 
 
In many complex scenarios it may be difficult to determine original sources of wealth, 
possibly accrued many years ago. In such scenarios, reasonable efforts must be 
undertaken to obtain relevant information from the client, and this must be reviewed in light 
of other risk factors, such as jurisdictional/geographic risk, adverse media, PEP status and 
transaction type (especially transactions which may help obscure the ownership or transfer 
of assets). 
 
Although a practice may not have specific information about assets not deposited or 
processed by them, it may be possible to gather general information from commercial 
databases or other open sources. 
 
Where the client’s SoW is not readily apparent, the first step in establishing either SoF 
or SoW is asking questions of your client and where appropriate seeking independent 
verification and corroboration of information across a variety of sources, to build a 
picture of the client’s background and circumstance which may require asking questions 
of the client. 
 
Actions taken, documentation and materials reviewed, and decisions taken (including 
rationale) must be clearly recorded. These may be reviewed at a later date by your 
supervisor or other relevant authorities. 
 
Where you cannot successfully establish the SoW in higher risk situations, you should 
consider ceasing to act for the client and whether you need to submit a report to the 
NCA. 
6.18.4 Enhanced monitoring 
Enhanced ongoing monitoring is automatically required whenever EDD is applied. 
 
One aspect of keeping transactions under review is to ensure they are still in line with the 
CDD information held on the client, and information contained in the client and matter risk 
assessments. Whatever controls you have in place to monitor other business 
relationships, may be intensified in order to apply enhanced monitoring.  
 
This may include: 
• requiring a greater level of information and explanation from the client when 
activity diverts from that addressed in their client risk assessment;  
• greater frequency of checks on transactions, particularly SoF; or 
• undertaking more frequent due diligence checks on your client. 
You should ensure that funds paid into your client account come from an expected source 
and are for an amount commensurate with the client's known wealth and with what is 
expected to be deposited in relation to the matters on which you act for them.
