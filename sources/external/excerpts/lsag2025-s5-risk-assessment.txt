Risk Assessment Methodology

5.13 Firms must undertake a documented risk assessment for each client matter. The risk assessment should:

(a) Consider the risk factors relevant to the client and matter;

(b) Apply a consistent methodology to score or categorise risk;

(c) Document the rationale for the risk rating assigned;

(d) Be proportionate to the nature and size of the firm's business;

(e) Be reviewed and updated periodically, and when there is a material change in circumstances.

The risk assessment should result in a clear determination of whether the matter presents low, medium, or high risk. Firms should ensure that the methodology used is applied consistently across all matters.
