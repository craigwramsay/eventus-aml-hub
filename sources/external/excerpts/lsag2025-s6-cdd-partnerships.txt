6.14.13 Partnerships, limited partnerships, Scottish limited partnerships and UK LLPs 
A partnership, other than in Scotland, is not a separate legal entity, so you must 
obtain information on the constituent individuals. 

 
 
 
Where partnerships or unincorporated businesses are well-known, reputable organisations, 
with long histories in their industries and with substantial public information about them, their 
principals, and controllers the following information may be sufficient: 
 
• name; 
• registered address, if any; 
• trading address; and 
• nature of business. 
 
You must still verify the identity of the partnership’s beneficial owners. 
 
R5(3) provides that in the case of a partnership (but not a limited liability partnership) 
the following individuals are beneficial owners: 
 
• any individual ultimately entitled to or who controls, (whether directly or 
indirectly), more than 25 per cent of the capital or profits of the partnership or 
more than 25 per cent of the voting rights in the partnership; or 
• any individual who otherwise exercises control over the management of the 
partnership. 
 
Relevant points to consider when applying R5(3) are: 
 
• the property of the entity includes its capital and its profits; and 
• control involves the ability to manage the use of funds or transactions outside of 
the normal management structure and control mechanisms 
 
You should also consider whether there are any other registries on which you may be able 
to verify the details of the partnership.  
 
Other partnerships and unincorporated businesses which are small and have few partners 
should be treated for identification and verification purposes in the same way as private 
individuals (i.e., identifying and verifying each partner). Where the numbers are larger, 
they should be treated for identification and verification purposes in the same way as 
private companies. 
 
Where a partnership is made up of regulated professionals, it may be sufficient to confirm 
the practice's existence and the trading address from a reputable professional directory or 
search facility with the relevant professional body. Otherwise, you should obtain evidence 
on the identity of at least two partners and evidence of the practice's trading address. You 
must still verify the identity of the partnership’s beneficial owners. 
 
For a UK LLP or SLP, you should obtain information in accordance with the requirements 
for companies as outlined above as these are treated as corporate entities. 
 
Careful consideration should be made regarding clients where partners themselves are 
overseas entities, particularly where these overseas entities are located in jurisdictions 
where no publicly available corporate registers are available, or ownership can be 
otherwise concealed through the use of nominees or similar structures. This is particularly 
relevant where the vehicle is used to hold assets or is involved in transactional or other 
potentially high-risk activities, or conversely, where no discernible business activity can be 
determined, from internet searches or other sources. Such factors may be indicative of 
shell companies and are likely to be indicative of higher ML risk. You should give 

 
 
consideration to why the use of such structures may not be legitimate and the nature and 
purpose of the business. Your client may be able to help you understand this. Information 
obtained should be considered in light of other CDD information available.  
 
Where you have assessed the client risk to be higher risk because of its structure or 
factors as above, then you must put in place enhanced due diligence and ongoing 
monitoring.

6.14.14 Foundations 
 
Foundations may or may not have legal personality. You should investigate whether this 
is the case and whether it is appropriate to take on the foundation as your client or 
whether your client should be the board of trustees or another party involved with the 
foundation. 
 
If the foundation lacks legal personality, you should approach CDD, as you would where 
you act for a client in relation to a trust. R6(5) provides that ‘beneficial owner’ in relation to 
a foundation or other legal arrangement similar to a trust, means those individuals who 
hold equivalent or similar positions to the (defined) beneficial owners of trusts.
