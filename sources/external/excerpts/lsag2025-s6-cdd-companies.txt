6.14.11 Companies – General Requirements 
 
You must identify and verify 
• the name of the company; 
• its company number or other registration number; and 
• the address of its registered office, and if different, its principal place of business. 
 
Furthermore, the practice must take reasonable measures to determine and verify the law to 
which the company is subject, and its constitution (whether set out in its articles of association 
or other governing documents) and the full names of the board of directors (or if there is no 
board, the members of the equivalent management body) and the senior persons responsible 
for the operations of the body corporate.  
A practice must collect proof of registration (e.g., via the client) or an excerpt from the 
relevant register before establishing a business relationship with a:  
• UK company (registered or unregistered as defined in the Unregistered Companies 
Regulations 2009(1)); 

 
 
• UK Limited Liability Partnership; or  
• Scottish Partnership. 
You must collect proof of registration (e.g., via the client) or an excerpt from the relevant 
register.  
 
Discrepancies in this information must be reported to the registrar, see Section 12 for more 
details. 
Where the client is beneficially owned by another person, the practice must also: 
• identify the beneficial owner; and 
• take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner, along with the 
ownership and control structure of the non-natural person R28(4)(c). 
These reasonable measures for verifying the identity of a non-natural person, may be 
easier to undertake for smaller entities where the beneficial owners may be more 
accessible. For larger entities where the beneficial owners may be more difficult to contact 
directly, EID&V may be of significant help when verifying their identities. 
 
Where a company is well-known or regulated for AML to a standard equivalent to which 
you are subject to in the UK you may consider that the level of money laundering and 
terrorist financing risks are low and apply CDD on a risk-based approach. For listed 
companies see below. 
 
Where you commence acting for a wholly owned subsidiary of an existing client, you may 
refer to the CDD file for your existing client for verification of details of the subsidiary, 
provided that the existing client has been identified to the standards of the Regulations or 
to a similar standard in another jurisdiction. 
 
6.14.11.1 Public companies listed on Regulated Markets 
 
You must obtain and verify the: 
 
• company name; 
• company number or other registration number; and 
• address of the registered office and, if different, principal place of business. 
 
In accordance with R28(5), if the company is listed on a regulated market it is not 
necessary to: 
 
• obtain information about the beneficial owners of the company; or 
• take  reasonable  measures  to  determine  and  verify  the  law  to  which  it  is 
subject or the names of its directors and senior persons. 
 
This may also be applied to a majority-owned subsidiary of such a company 
where you have established the nature of ownership via an independent and 
reliable source. 
 
For a wholly owned subsidiary of a listed company, you will also require 
evidence of the parent/subsidiary relationship. Such evidence may be: 
 
• the subsidiary's last filed annual return/confirmation; 

 
 
• a note in the parent's or subsidiary's last audited accounts or annual report; 
• information  from  a reputable  electronic  verification  service  provider  or  online 
registry; or 
• information from the parent company’s published reports, for example, from their 
website. 
 
“Regulated market” is defined as follows: 
• Within  the  EEA,  the  meaning  given  by  Article  4.1  (14)  of  the  Markets  in 
Financial Instruments Directive; and 
• Outside the EEA, a regulated financial market which subjects’ companies 
whose securities are admitted to trading to disclosure obligations which are 
equivalent to the specified disclosure obligations. 
 
“specified disclosure obligations” means— 
 
(a)disclosure obligations set out in Articles 17 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16th April 2014 on market abuse 
(22); 
(b)disclosure obligations consistent with Articles 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14 and 16 of Directive 
2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4th November 2003 on 
the prospectuses to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted 
to trading(23); 
(c)disclosure obligations consistent with Articles 4 to 6, 14, 16 to 19 and 30 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15th 
December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to 
information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated 
market(24); and 
(d)disclosure requirements consistent with EU legislation made under the provisions 
mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c); 
 
 
If a regulated market is located within the EEA there is no requirement to undertake 
checks on the market itself. Under a risk-based approach you may wish to simply record 
the steps taken to ascertain the status of the market. 
 
Consider a similar approach for non-EEA markets that subject companies to disclosure 
obligations which are contained in international standards equivalent to specified 
disclosure obligations in the EU. Jurisdictional AML risks should also be considered – 
see the risk assessment section of this guidance for further information. 
 
Consult the register on the European Securities and Markets Authority website. 
Following an assessment that the client is low risk it will be sufficient, for a listed 
company, to obtain confirmation of the company's listing on the regulated market.  
 
Such evidence may be: 
 
• a copy of the dated page of the website of the relevant stock exchange 
showing the listing; 
• a photocopy of the listing in a reputable newspaper; or 
• information  from  a  reputable  electronic  verification  service  provider  or  online 
registry. 
 

 
 
Where a listed company is owned by multiple parties that are themselves held on a 
regulated market(s), this does not need to be treated differently to a listed company that 
is a wholly owned subsidiary of one, except that you need to collect the details of all 
owners as above. 
 
When assessing a listed company’s relationship with a market, you should have regard to 
whether a company’s ownership is only partially available on a market i.e., only a 
percentage is publicly held. In this context, you should consider seeking further 
information about any owners whose relationship is not through a regulated market on a 
risk sensitive basis. In other words, a company having any proportion of a listing on a 
regulated market however small, does not mean you do not need to check other owners. 
 
The regulated market in the UK is the London Stock Exchange. You may consider whether 
it is appropriate to treat companies listed on other markets in the same way as those 
meeting the definition of “regulated markets” on a risk sensitive basis. For example, AIM is 
not a ‘regulated market’, but you may consider, on a risk-based approach, treating it as 
such. 
 
Where further CDD is required for a listed company (i.e., when it is not on a regulated 
market or where you otherwise deem it necessary) consider the nature of the risks 
presented and obtain additional information/comforts to address those risks.  This may 
include obtaining relevant information or particulars of the company's identity or business 
practices. 
 
Verification sources may include: 
 
• a search of the relevant company registry (such as Companies House); 
• a copy of the company's certificate of incorporation; 
• a copy of their audited accounts; or 
• information from a reputable electronic verification service provider. 
 
You are still required to conduct ongoing monitoring of the business relationship with a publicly 
listed company to enable you to spot suspicious activity. 
 
Companies whose listing does not fall within the above requirements should be identified in 
accordance with the provisions for private companies. 
 
6.14.11.2 Private and unlisted companies in the UK 
 
Private companies are generally subject to a lower level of public disclosure than 
public companies. In general, however, the structure, ownership, purposes and 
activities of many private companies will be clear and understandable. 
 
Sources for verifying corporate identification may include: 
 
• certificate of incorporation; 
• articles of association (or equivalent formation documents); 
• details from the relevant company registry, confirming details of the company and 
of the director/s and their addresses; 
• filed audited accounts; or 
• information from a reputable electronic verification service provider. 

 
 
 
R43 requires UK companies not listed on a regulated market to provide information 
about their identity on request, including their articles of association or other governing 
documents and information about beneficial owners. 
 
6.14.11.3 Private and unlisted overseas companies 
 
Obtaining CDD material for these companies may be more difficult, particularly 
regarding beneficial ownership where ownership is held in jurisdictions where no 
publicly available corporate registers are available, or ownership can be otherwise 
concealed through the use of nominees. If this is the case, it should be taken as an 
increased risk factor and may warrant the application of enhanced due diligence 
measures. 
 
The company's identity should be established in the same way as for UK private and 
unlisted companies. 
Where you are not obtaining original documentation, you should consider the need for 
further comfort on authenticity on a risk-based approach. Certification of documents does 
not automatically guarantee documentation is genuine.  
 
6.14.11.4 The Register of Overseas Entities 
 
Overseas entities wishing to buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK must now 
register with Companies House. An overseas entity is defined as a legal entity governed 
by the law of a country or territory outside the UK. 
 
This requirement applies to overseas entities who own real property in the UK and have 
done so since:  
 
• in England and Wales, on or since 1 January 1999 
• in Scotland, on or since 8 December 2014 
• in Northern Ireland, on or since 5 September 2022. 
Regulation 28(9) does not exclude the ROE as a register on which you can rely on for the 
purposes of verification under 28(4). Nonetheless, it is important not to rely solely on this or 
any other register. Regulation 30A, for example, introduced a discrepancy reporting 
requirement for the ROE which indicates that inconsistency may occur. The information 
provided by such registers should be verified independently. 
Entries on the Register of Overseas Interests are not public but copies may be obtained on 
application to Companies House.
