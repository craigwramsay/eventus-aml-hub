6.14.15 Charities 
 
Charities may take a number of forms. In the UK, you may come across five types of 
charities: 
 
• small; 
• registered; 
• unregistered; 
• excepted, such as churches; or 
• exempt, such as museums and universities. 
 
For registered charities, you should take a record of their full name, registration number 
and place of business. Details of registered charities in the UK can be obtained from: 
 
• the Charity Commission of England and Wales; 
• the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator; or 
• the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland. 
 
Other countries may also have charity regulators which maintain a list of registered 
charities. You may consider it appropriate to refer to these when verifying the identity of 
an overseas charity. 
 
For all other types of charities, you should consider the business structure of the charity 
and apply CDD appropriately. You may also get confirmation of UK charitable status from 
HMRC. Further, in applying the risk-based approach to charities it is worth considering 
whether it is a well-known entity or not. The more obscure the charity, the more likely you 
are to want to view the constitutional documents of the charity, along with any other 
documents that may clarify the individuals in control and its status. 
 

 
 
Due to the numerous examples of charities and not-for-profit organisations as fund raising 
vehicles for terrorist organisations you may want to also consult HM Treasury's 
consolidated list of persons designated as being subject to financial restrictions to ensure 
the charity is not a designated person. 
 
Another point to consider is Source of Funds, in that charities may fund transactions 
effectively through crowdfunding, which can make a Source of Funds check difficult to 
complete. Taking a risk-based approach you should consider whether you need to seek 
information as to who those individuals or entities are that are funding the charity, 
particularly those contributing larger percentages or amounts. 
6.14.16 Deceased persons' estates 
 
When acting for the executor(s) or administrators of an estate, you should establish their 
identity using the procedures for natural persons or companies set out above. When 
acting for more than one executor or administrator, you should verify the identity of at 
least two of them. You should also get copies of the death certificate, grant of probate 
and any letters of administration. 
 
If a will trust is created, and the trustees are different from the executors, the procedures 
in relation to trusts will need to be followed when the will trust comes into operation. 
 
6.14.17 Churches and places of worship 
 
Places of worship may either register as a charity or can apply for registration as a certified 
building of worship from the General Register Office (GRO) which will issue a certificate. 
Further, their charitable tax status will be registered with HMRC. As such, identification 
details with respect to the church or place of worship may be verified: 
 
• as for a charity; 
• through the headquarters or regional organisation of the denomination or 
religion; 
• with reference to the GRO certificate; or 
• through an enquiry to HMRC. 
 
6.14.18 Schools and colleges 
 
Schools and colleges may be a registered charity, a private company, an 
unincorporated association or a government entity and should be verified in 
accordance with the relevant category. The Department of Education maintains 
lists of approved educational establishments which may assist in verifying the 
existence of the school or college. 
 
6.14.19 Clubs and associations 
 
Many of these bear a low money laundering risk, but this depends on the scope of 
their purposes, ownership structure, activities and geographic spread. 

 
 
 
The following information may be relevant to the identity of the club or association: 
 
• full name; 
• legal status; 
• purpose; 
• any registered address; or 
• names of all office holders. 
 
Documents which may verify the existence of the club or association include: 
 
• any articles of association or constitution; 
• statement from a bank, building society or credit union; 
• recent audited accounts; or 
• financial statements presented to the annual general meeting. 
 
6.14.20 Government agencies and councils 
 
The money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with public authorities vary 
significantly depending on the nature of the retainer and the home jurisdiction of the public 
authority. It may be simple to establish that the entity exists, but where there is a 
heightened risk of corruption or misappropriation of government monies, greater monitoring 
of retainers should be applied. 
 
The following information may be relevant when establishing a public sector entity's 
identity: 
 
• full name of the entity; 
• nature and status of the entity; 
• address of the entity; 
• name of the home state authority; 
• name of the directors or equivalent; 
• name of the individual instructing you and confirmation of their authority to do so; 
or 
• extract from official government website. 
 
Under R37(3) the fact that the client is a public administration or publicly owned enterprise 
is one of the factors to consider when deciding whether it is low risk and whether to apply 
simplified due diligence. It will usually be appropriate to apply simplified due diligence to 
UK public authorities and to some non-UK public authorities, particularly those in the EEA. 
 
6.14.21 Further Information 
 
You may wish to consider the UK Financial Services Joint Money Laundering 
Steering Group (JMLSG) guidance Part 1 – (available here) as a useful source of 
information on possible ways to apply CDD on the above entities, and across a 
broader range of other entity structures. You should note though that in the context of 
legal services, the LSAG guidance takes precedent.
