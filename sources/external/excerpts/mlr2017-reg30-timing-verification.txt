(2)  Subject to paragraph (3) or (4), a relevant person must comply with the requirement to verify
the identity of the customer, any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer and any beneficial
owner of the customer before the establishment of a business relationship or the carrying out of the
transaction.
(3)    Provided  that  the  verification  is  completed  as  soon  as  practicable  after  contact  is  first
established, the verification of the customer, any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer

relationship if—

(b)there is little risk of money laundering and terrorist financing.
(4)  The verification by a credit institution or a financial institution of the identity of a customer
opening an account, any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer and any beneficial owner
of the customer, may take place after the account has been opened provided that there are adequate
safeguards in place to ensure that no transactions are carried out by or on behalf of the customer
before verification has been completed.
(5)  For the purposes of paragraph (4) “account” includes an account which permits transactions
in transferable securities.

(6)  Paragraph (7) applies if—
(a)the relevant person is required to apply customer due diligence measures in the case of
a trust, a legal entity (other than a body corporate) or a legal arrangement (other than a
trust); and
(b)the  beneficiaries  of  that  trust,  entity  or  arrangement  are  designated  as  a  class,  or  by
reference to particular characteristics.
(7)  If this paragraph applies, the relevant person must establish and verify the identity of any
beneficiary before—
(a)any payment is made to the beneficiary; or
