6.15 Beneficial ownership requirements 
 
6.15.1 Definition of a beneficial owner 
 
A beneficial owner is normally an individual who ultimately owns or controls the customer 
or on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. In respect of private individuals (i.e., 
a natural person), the client themselves may be treated as the beneficial owner, unless 
there are features of the transaction, or surrounding circumstances, that indicate 
otherwise.  
 
Therefore, if your client is an individual, you may want to consider whether they are acting 
on their own behalf. A question to ask yourself in this context and more generally is: “do 
the services I am being asked to provide make sense given what I know about the client?” 
 
R5(1) defines the beneficial owner of a body corporate, other than a listed company, as 
meaning: 
 
any individual who: 
 
• exercises ultimate control over the management of the body corporate; 
• ultimately owns or controls, directly or indirectly, including through bearer share 
holdings or other means, more than 25% of the shares or voting rights in the body 
corporate; 
• otherwise controls the body: 
o by satisfying one or more of the conditions set out in Part 1 of 
Schedule 1A to the Companies Act 2006 (persons with significant 
control); or 
o if the individual were an undertaking, the body corporate would be a 
subsidiary undertaking of the individual under section1162 of the 
Companies Act 2006 read with Part 7 of that Act. 
 
This does not apply to a company listed on a regulated market. It does apply to UK 
limited liability partnerships. 
 
Regulation 6(1) In relation to a trust, the Regulations define the beneficial owner as each of:  
• the settlor;  
• the trustees;  
• the beneficiaries, or where the individuals benefiting from the trust have not been 
determined,  the  class  of  persons  in  whose  main  interest  the  trust  is  set  up,  or 
operates; and 
• any individual who has control over the trust.  
In relation to a foundation or other legal arrangement similar to a trust, the beneficial owners 
are  those  who  hold  equivalent  or  similar  positions  to  those  set  out  above  in  the  case  of 
trusts. 
 
In  relation  to  a  legal  entity  or  legal  arrangement  which  does  not  fall  into  the  above,  the 
beneficial owners are:  
• any individual who benefits from the property of the entity or arrangement;  

 
 
• where the  individuals  who  benefit from  the  entity or  arrangement  have  yet  to  be 
identified, the class of persons in whose main interest the entity or arrangement is 
set up or operates; and 
• any individual who exercises control over the property of the entity or arrangement. 
Unincorporated associations and foundations are examples of entities and 
arrangements likely to fall within these requirements. 
 
When applying this, relevant points to consider are: 
 
• the property of the entity includes its capital and its profits; 
• determined benefits are those to which an individual is currently entitled; 
• contingent benefits or situations where no determination has been made 
should be dealt with as a class to which (and because) benefit has yet to be 
determined; 
• a class of persons need only be identified by description; 
• an  entity  or  arrangement  is  set  up  for,  or  operates  in,  the  main  interest  of  the 
persons who are likely to get most of the property; 
• control includes the ability to manage the use of funds or transactions outside the 
normal management structure and control mechanisms; and 
• where you find a body corporate with the requisite interest outlined above, you will 
need to make further proportionate enquiries as to the beneficial owner of the 
body corporate. 
 
6.15.2 Other forms of control 
 
You should be alert to the risk that a corporate entity can also be subject to control by 
persons other than shareholders. Such control may rest with those who have power to 
manage funds or transactions without requiring specific authority to do so, and who would 
be in a position to authorise changes to internal procedures and control mechanisms. 
Depending on the control structures in an entity, this could be a senior role operating 
without actual or effective supervision or another entity. 
 
You should remain alert to any person or entity with such powers while you are obtaining 
an understanding of the ownership and control structure of the corporate entity and make 
such further enquiries you need in order to understand the control structure. Monitor 
situations within the retainer where control structures appear to be bypassed or unduly 
complex on a risk sensitive basis. 
 
6.16 CDD on a beneficial owner 
 
6.16.1 General Comments  
 
Beneficial Owners must be identified, and reasonable measures must be taken to verify 
their identities so that you are satisfied you know who the beneficial owner is and that they 
are in fact the beneficial owner in question.  
 
In complex structures, practices may have to look through layers of ownership (and 
consider any associated dilution of that ownership) to arrive at any natural persons owning 
or controlling the client entity.  

 
 
 
It is important to review both shareholdings and voting rights in respect of beneficial 
ownership, along with understanding the class and value of shares any individual holds. 
 
Where the shareholding of an entity indicates that no one owns or controls over 25% of a 
client you may wish to consider whether it is appropriate that the senior manager (e.g., 
CEO, board, controlling mind of the company) be considered as the beneficial owners 
under R5(1))(a) and (c). This is subtly different to the requirements of R28(8) and would 
not necessarily raise a concern of extra risks as the circumstances of R28(7) might. 
 
When conducting CDD on a client, you will need to identify any beneficial owners as 
defined above. This may be undertaken by obtaining: 
 
• shareholder details from a reputable online registry or commercial provider; 
• a copy of a detailed structure chart; and 
• a copy of the trust deed, partnership agreement or other such document. 
 
It is not enough to solely rely on the information contained in a company’s register of 
persons with significant control. You should consider what is the appropriate level of 
verification required on an RBA. 
 
These reasonable measures to verify a beneficial owner, may differ to those you may use 
to verify the identity of a client that is a natural person. For example, you may not require 
passports or driving licenses in these circumstances, but EID&V may present an effective 
way to verify the identities of beneficial owners.   
 
It is for your practice to determine a tailored and risk sensitive approach that is appropriate 
to ensure you are satisfied you know who a beneficial owner is and that you fully 
understand their relationship with the non-natural person. 
6.16.2 Requirements introduced in 2020 
 
If you cannot identify the beneficial owner (where they have more than 25% holding of the 
company), you should consider whether this makes the client or matter higher risk and treat 
it accordingly and consider whether you should continue to act for the client. 
 
If you cannot identify a beneficial owner pursuant to the above despite having exhausted all 
possible means of doing so or if you are not satisfied that the person is the beneficial owner, 
you must then take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the senior responsible 
manager of the body corporate. Depending on the circumstances, it may be that you have 
already concluded this is the case on the basis that the individual “exercises ultimate control 
over the management of the body corporate” under Regulation 5(1)(a), although you should 
note that the scope of Regulation 5(1)(a) is not limited to this scenario. 
In practice, this may be the Chief Executive Officer or President of the group, or someone 
else in the executive team with high level responsibility for the running of the relevant aspect 
of the body corporate. 
 
You must also record: 
• All the actions you have undertaken to this end; and 
• Any difficulties encountered. 

 
 
 
6.16.3 Agency 
 
R6(9) says a beneficial owner generally means any individual who ultimately owns or 
controls the client or on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. 
 
In most cases, it is presumed that the client is acting on their own behalf, unless the 
features of the transaction indicate that they are acting on someone else's behalf.  As 
highlighted above you should make enquiries when it appears the client may be acting on 
behalf of someone else. 
 
Situations where a natural person may be acting on behalf of someone else include: 
 
• exercising a power of attorney - the document granting power of attorney may be 
sufficient to verify the beneficial owner's identity; 
• acting  as  the  deputy,  administrator  or  insolvency  practitioner - appointment 
documents may be sufficient to verify the beneficial owner's identity; or 
• acting as an appointed broker or other agent to conduct a transaction - signed 
letter of appointment may be sufficient to verify the beneficial owner's identity. 
 
You should be alert to the possibility that purported agency relationships are actually 
being utilised to facilitate a fraud, leading to possible encounters with the proceeds of 
crime. Understanding the reason for the agency, rather than simply accepting 
documentary evidence of such at face value, will assist to mitigate this risk. Where a 
client or retainer is higher risk, you should obtain further verification of the beneficial 
owner's identity in line with the suggested CDD methods to be applied to natural persons. 
 
This may also include where a legal practice commissions your services on behalf of 
someone else.  
 
6.16.4 Companies 
 
6.16.4.1 A proportionate approach 
 
Where you have adequately assessed ML risk to be lower, it would not be generally 
proportionate to conduct independent searches across multiple entities at multiple layers 
of a corporate chain to see whether, by accumulating very small interests in different 
entities, a person finally achieves more than a 25 per cent interest in the client corporate 
entity. Nevertheless, you must be satisfied that you have an overall understanding of the 
ownership and control structure of the client company. This provision does not apply in 
any situations of higher risk, where EDD should be applied. 
 
6.16.4.2 Companies with capital in the form of bearer shares 
 
A bearer share is a form of equity (i.e., a stock or share in a company or equivalent) wholly 
owned by whoever holds the physical stock certificate. Given this, there is no way to 
register the owner of the stock confidently or consistently nor track transfers of ownership 
 

 
 
These pose a much higher risk of money laundering as it is often difficult to identify 
beneficial owners and such companies are often incorporated in jurisdictions with lower 
AML/CTF regulations. You should consider whether the risk posed is acceptable for your 
practice before proceeding.  
 
If you do proceed, you must adopt procedures to establish the identities of the holders and 
material beneficial owners of such shares and ensure you are notified whenever there is a 
change of holder and/or beneficial owner (i.e., who they are held on behalf of).  
 
This might be achieved by: 
 
• requiring that the shares be deposited with you or a regulated person with whom 
you have a binding covenant; or  
• getting appropriate assurance that either such a regulated person or the holder 
of the shares will notify you of any change of records/holder/ownership relating 
to the shares. 
 
Ultimately it is for your practice to determine the confidence you can place in any assurances 
that the bearer shares will not be used to hide money laundering or terrorist financing, 
however extreme caution must be exercised. Bear in mind that the issuance of bearer 
shares has been banned in the UK since May 2015, primarily due to money laundering and 
transparency concerns. Enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring should be 
performed and practices must be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of controls in place 
to their supervisor. 
 
Where a practice does undertake work for clients where beneficial ownership is held in the 
form of bearer shares, this should be articulated in the Practice-Wide Risk Assessment. 
 
6.16.5 Trusts 
Whenever you are instructed by someone involved with an existing trust to advise in relation 
to it, you must extend your CDD to the trust’s beneficial owners.  
 
You should take a risk-based approach to verifying the identity of the ultimate beneficial 
owner/s of a professional trustee entity (as they should have no interest in the assets placed 
in trust). Higher-risk indicators may be where the professional trustee entity is unregulated or 
where the professional trustee is not independent of the settlor (e.g., family offices). Where 
such factors are present, reasonable measures should be taken to verify the identity of the 
beneficial owner/s of the trustee. Lower risk factors may be where the professional trustee is 
itself a regulated entity (or owned by one) or is large, well-known and/or listed on a regulated 
market. In such low-risk instances, you should not need to identify and verify beneficial 
ownership of the professional trustee, although you should document the rationale for your 
actions. 
 
R28(4)(a) requires a relevant person to identify the beneficial owner ‘of a client’ which is 
beneficially owned by another person. R6(1) defines ‘the beneficial owners in relation to a 
trust’ as the settlor, the trustees, the beneficiaries (or class of beneficiaries) and any 
individual who has control over the trust. Although your client will not actually be the trust 
(because a trust does not have legal personality), if you advise any client in relation to a 
trust, the Regulations require you to understand who the trust's other beneficial owners are, 
as defined in R6(1).
