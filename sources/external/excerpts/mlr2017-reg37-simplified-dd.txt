Application of simplified customer due diligence
37.—(1)  A relevant person may apply simplified customer due diligence measures in relation

(b)relevant information made available to it under regulations 17(9) and 47; and
(c)the risk factors referred to in paragraph (3).
(2)  Where a relevant person applies simplified customer due diligence measures, it must—
(a)

its determination under paragraph (1); and
(b)carry  out  sufficient  monitoring  of  any  business  relationships  or  transactions  which  are
subject to those measures to enable it to detect any unusual or suspicious transactions.
(3)    When  assessing  whether  there  is  a  low  degree  of  risk  of  money  laundering  and  terrorist
financing  in  a  particular  situation,  and  the  extent  to  which  it  is  appropriate  to  apply  simplified

customer  due  diligence  measures  in  that  situation,  the  relevant  person  must  take  account  of  risk

surrender option, and cannot be used as collateral;

financing;

the presence of one or more risk factors may not always indicate that there is a low risk of money
laundering and terrorist financing in a particular situation.

risk of money laundering and terrorist financing; and

account is available, on request to the relevant person where the pooled account is held.
