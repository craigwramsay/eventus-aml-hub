5.6.3 Product or Service Risks 
 
You should consider the following questions:  
 
• Does the practice offer any services which may attract a higher level of risk such as 
large volume/high value conveyancing, corporate acquisitions, tax mitigation 
strategies, work involving high-risk jurisdictions or the creation and/or management of 
specialist entities? 
• Does the practice have the necessary expertise and experience to undertake the 
work requested? 
• Does the practice undertake work which may be of lower AML risk (e.g., 
executorship, wills, litigation)? 
 
 
The National Risk Assessment highlights that independent legal professionals face the 
greatest potential risks in the following areas: 
• misuse of client accounts; 
• sale/purchase of real property; 
• creation of trusts, companies and charities; 
• management of trusts and companies; and 
• sham litigation. 
 
Consideration should be given to whether the practice undertakes work with exposure to 
these risks and this should be documented in your PWRA accordingly.  
 
Other factors to consider are the value, complexity and nature of work in these areas in the 
context of the client and/or the nature of the work that your practice normally undertakes.  
 
5.6.3.1 Sale/purchase of real property 
 
According to law enforcement authorities and the national risk assessment, the sale and 
purchase of real estate is a common method for disposing of or converting criminal 
proceeds. 
 
Real estate is generally an appreciating asset and the subsequent sale of the asset can 
provide an apparently legitimate reason for the existence of the funds. Property matters are 
an attractive method of laundering criminal proceeds because: 
• Property is often a high value asset – it offers the opportunity to legitimatise large 
amounts of money in one go; 
• The value of property generally appreciates – this is unusual for criminals who 
usually lose money when laundering; 

 
 
• The nature of conveyancing means that matters/transactions often happen extremely 
quickly – and therefore it is easier to hide behind a complicated money trail which 
can be constructed very quickly, and the onward sale of a property can give the 
appearance of a legitimate income stream; 
• Property can be used to generate additional quasi-legitimate income streams e.g., 
rental; and 
• Property can be used by the money launderer or an associate as a residence.  
 
Transfers of real estate from one owner to another without the exchange of funds, may 
present an equal risk to the purchase of property. 
5.6.3.2 Client accounts and payments 
 
You should consider the risk that criminals may attempt to misuse your client account. 
Putting the proceeds of crime through your client account can give funds the appearance of 
legitimacy, as the subsequent transfer will show as having originated from a regulated legal 
practice. It will also help obscure the audit trail of funds whether the money is sent back to 
the client, on to a third party, or invested in some way. 
 
Introducing cash into the banking system can be part of the placement stage of money 
laundering. The risk of this occurring, along with the controls in place at the practice to 
prevent this happening, should form part of your PWRA. 
 
Generally speaking, you should avoid accepting cash payments to your client account in 
relation to transactions. If you do choose to accept these as a policy of your practice, it 
should be considered high risk within the PWRA particularly where large in size (e.g., above 
£1,000). At a client or matter level, you should establish Source of funds for any cash 
payments and treat the funds on a risk sensitive basis. There may be valid reasons for 
accepting cash into the client account (e.g., access to justice or in cases of domestic 
disputes) – reasons for accepting any cash payment should be clearly documented. 
 
5.6.3.3 Formation and management of trusts and companies  
 
Company and trust structures may be exploited by criminals who wish to retain control over 
criminally derived assets while creating impediments to law enforcement agencies in tracing 
the origin and ownership of assets. Criminals may ask legal professionals to create 
companies and trusts and/or to manage companies and trusts, to provide greater 
respectability and legitimacy to the entities and their activities. 
Your PWRA should consider the practice’s exposure to this type of work, and the risks 
involved– especially where the practice undertakes complex company or trust work for 
clients involving higher risk jurisdictions. This is particularly important where beneficial 
ownership or nature of business can be obscured or anonymised, or the use of nominees or 
bearer shares is permitted. 
 
Shell companies are corporate entities that do not have any business activities or assets. 
They may be used for legitimate purposes such as serving as a temporary transaction 
vehicle. However, they can also be an easy and inexpensive way to disguise beneficial 
ownership and the flow of illegitimate funds and so are attractive to criminals engaged in 
money laundering. You should consider it as high risk if a client engages your services only 
in connection with the routine aspects of forming an entity, without seeking further legal 
advice on the appropriateness of the corporate structure and related matters. In jurisdictions 
where members of the public may register companies themselves with the company registry, 

 
 
the engagement of a legal professional to register the company (or to use the practice’s 
address) may indicate that the client is seeking to add the appearance of legitimacy to a 
company. 
 
5.6.3.4 Other Services 
 
Other services to consider in risk assessments are: 
• Services where legal professionals may represent or assure the client’s standing, 
reputation and credibility to third parties, without a commensurate knowledge of the 
client’s affairs; 
• Acquisitions of businesses in liquidation; and 
• Services offered to clients in the context of trade based or trade-finance 
arrangements. 
5.6.3.5 Risk of offering both in-scope and out-of-scope services 
 
Many practices have both an AML-compliant client onboarding (take-on) process and a 
separate process for those areas of activity outside the scope of the Regulations. This is 
permissible, but it does create a risk. 
 
The risk is that if a client is onboarded via an AML non-compliant process for out-of-scope 
work, and then transferred over to AML in-scope services, there is likely to be a need to 
apply further due diligence, in order to bring the original due diligence up to the required 
standard. 
 
To mitigate this risk practices may either have clear and robust PCPs in place to manage 
the transition or conduct full AML-compliant CDD regardless of the nature of the matter. 
This would enable a client to be transferred more easily between a practice’s out-of-scope 
and in-scope services. 
 
5.6.3.6 Dealing with payments credited to your client account without permission 
 
Legal professionals may receive funds that are either overpayments, or completely 
unasked for deposits. You should give consideration to the possibility that any unsolicited 
payment or unexpected overpayment may have been engineered for the purposes of 
money laundering and treat these instances appropriately (including consideration of the 
submission of a SAR as appropriate). A repayment of funds from a legal professional’s 
account may help to legitimise the proceeds of crime. 
 
Such instances should be recorded in an appropriate place, for example in a client or 
matter risk assessment, or in the records of the MLRO. 
 
One way to deal with such matters is to set an internal value threshold, beyond which, 
greater consideration must be given to whether the circumstances prompt suspicion and a 
subsequent disclosure to the NCA. Except in exceptional circumstances funds received in 
such a manner should only be returned to the source from which they were received.   
 

 
 
R31(2) confirms that you are not prevented from repaying money deposited in your client 
account, provided that, if you have suspicion of money laundering, you obtain 
consent/DAML from NCA for the transaction. 
 
If you display your client account details freely, for example, on your letterhead or a 
website, the risk of them being abused by criminals is greatly increased. This is something 
you should avoid.
