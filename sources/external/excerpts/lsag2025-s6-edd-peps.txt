6.19.3 Screening, Due Diligence & Other Control Measures - Politically-Exposed Persons 
 
Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) present risks as they have the opportunity to use 
their political position to enrich themselves through corrupt activities. In order to treat 
PEPs in a risk-based way, it is a precondition that you can correctly identify them.  
6.19.3.1 Who is a PEP? 
 
A PEP is a person who has been entrusted within the last year (or for a longer period if 
you consider it appropriate to address the risks in relation to that person) with one of the 
following prominent public functions by a public institution, an international body, or a 
state, including the UK. 
 
Listing of PEP roles R35(14) 
• heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant 
ministers; 
• members of parliament or similar legislative bodies; 
• members of governing bodies of political parties; 
• members of supreme courts, of constitutional courts, or any judicial body 
whose decisions are not subject to further appeal, except in exceptional 
circumstances; 
• members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks; 
• ambassadors, charges d'affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces; 
• members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of 
state-owned enterprises; or 
• directors, deputy directors and members of the board of equivalent function of 
an international organisation. 
 
In addition to the primary PEPs listed above, a PEP also includes (R35(12)): 
• family members of a PEP – spouse, civil partner, children, their spouses or 
partners, and parents; and 
• known close associates of a PEP – persons with whom joint beneficial 
ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement is held, with whom there are 
close business relationships, or who is a sole beneficial owner of a legal entity 
or arrangement set up by the primary PEP. 
 
 
Middle ranking and junior officials are not PEPs. In the UK, only those who hold truly 
prominent positions should be treated as PEPs and the definition should not be applied to 
local government, more junior members of the civil service or military officials other than 

 
 
those holding the most senior ranks. This should be borne in mind as many commercially 
available PEP checking tools may have a much lower threshold for considering an 
individual a PEP. 
 
In the Government consultation on 5MLD, it was strongly suggested that the FCA’s 
guidance on PEPs should be the standard across the board.  
 
Section FCA guidance sets out the FCA’s view of what categories of person should be 
treated as PEPs in the UK (building on the above). 
 
6.19.3.2 Identifying a PEP 
 
R35(1) requires you to have appropriate risk management systems and procedures to 
determine whether a client or beneficial owner is a PEP. 
 
Practices must take a risk-based approach to identifying PEPs. 
 
To assess your risk of encountering a PEP, you must consider your PWRA, the level of 
risk of money laundering or terrorist financing inherent in your business and the extent 
to which that risk would be increased by a business relationship with a PEP. 
 
In larger or more specialist practices where it may be reasonably expected to undertake 
work on behalf of PEPs in the normal or regular course of business, frequency and 
intensity of PEP screening should be increased (potentially using an established 
commercial provider), both at the outset of the matter and an ongoing basis. Many 
practices use services that can run checks against PEP databases which they maintain.  
 
Where you have a higher risk of having PEPs as clients or you have reason to suspect that 
a person may actually be a PEP contrary to earlier information, you should consider 
conducting some form of electronic verification.  
 
The range of PEPs is wide and constantly changing, so any EID&V will not give you total 
certainty. You should have reference to Section 7 when considering the possible 
confidence you may place in the abilities of any EID&V tool. 
 
Regardless of the result of any single check you should consider the wider possibility that 
your client is a PEP. 
 
Questions you should ask with regard to PEP Status 
• What role(s) does the individual hold? 
• What is the nature and context of business relationship?  
• What services or products does the PEP wish to use?  
• What is the potential for the product to be misused for the purposes of 
corruption? 
• Do you know if they have close family members or known associates and if so, 
what roles do they hold? 
• What level of public scrutiny, exposure, governance, disclosures or accountability 
in their role is the PEP subject to? 
• Are their accompanying geographic risks associated with the PEP relationship? 
• If you have identified a PEP, were they helpful in providing this information and if 
not, should and how would this impact my assessment of the risk present? 

 
 
• Does the nature of their PEP status impact in the level of EDD that needs to be 
applied, and if so, how? 
 
In practices where undertaking work on behalf of PEPs is unlikely or a very rare 
occurrence, it may be acceptable to use publicly available or open sources. Checking for 
PEP status should be undertaken on a risk-based approach, in light of other CDD 
information held (such as employment) which may lead to the practice suspecting PEP 
status.  
 
Simple measures may include: 
• asking the client or their representative (as appropriate) whether the person is a 
PEP, as a part of client onboarding; 
• performing an internet search in order to check whether the individual may hold 
any position that qualifies them as a PEP; or 
• reviewing the information, they submit to you carefully to determine whether any 
information you have access to, suggests they may be a PEP. 
 
 
Other indicators that may indicate your client is a PEP include: 
 
• receiving funds from a government account; 
• correspondence on official letterhead from the client or a related person; 
• information from the client or person related to the matter linking the client to a PEP; 
and 
• any information which comes to your attention suggesting your client is actually 
a PEP or linked to one. 
 
Where you suspect a client is a PEP but cannot establish that for certain, you should 
consider what steps you could take in order to resolve this uncertainty. If you are not able to 
resolve the issue to your satisfaction, you may consider (on a risk-based approach) 
applying aspects of enhanced due diligence procedures (as a lack of clarity as to whether 
a person is a PEP could, in and of itself, be indicative of a heightened risk of money 
laundering). 
 
It is worth reiterating from the outset that family members of PEPs, and known close 
associates of PEPs, must be treated as PEPs in terms of the due diligence you apply.   
You should apply the same standard of investigation when identifying whether someone is 
a family member of a PEP, as you do for a PEP. 
 
R35(15) sets out a different process for “known close associates.” 
 
“For the purpose of deciding whether a person is a known close associate of a politically 
exposed person, a relevant person need only have regard to information which is in its 
possession, or to credible information which is publicly available.” This means that you are 
only expected to be able to identify a known close associate where the information you 
already hold tells you that this is what they are, or if it is publicly available. 
 
6.19.3.3 Mitigation of PEP Risk 
 
In deciding what risk mitigation to apply you must (R35(2)) take account of: 

 
 
• your PWRA; 
• the client or matter risk assessment; and 
• any information published by your supervisor. 
PEPs may pose a higher risk, by virtue of having a greater potential opportunity to be 
involved in corruption, due to the positions or access to public funds they hold. Being a 
PEP should not, preclude access to legal services, provided the practice undertakes the 
necessary enhanced due diligence measures. 
 
Since 10 January 2024 the regulations state that in relation to domestic PEPs, that is, 
those entrusted with prominent public functions by the United Kingdom: 
• the starting point for the assessment is that the client or potential client presents a 
lower level of risk than a non-domestic PEP, and 
• if no enhanced risk factors are present, the extent of EDD measures to be applied 
in relation to that client or potential client is less than the extent to be applied in the 
case of a non-domestic PEP. 
When there is a PEP relationship (including where a PEP is a beneficial owner of a 
client and where a client or its beneficial owner is a family member or known close 
associate of a PEP), the Regulations specify that you must take the following steps to 
deal with the heightened risk: 
 
• have senior management approval for establishing a business relationship 
with a PEP or an entity beneficially owned by a PEP; 
• take adequate measures to establish the SoF and SoW which are involved in the 
business relationship or occasional transaction; 
• conduct closer ongoing monitoring of the business relationship; and 
• consider which aspects of your EDD protocol are appropriate for the PEP in 
question. 
 
Where you have a beneficial owner who you know to be a PEP, you should consider on a 
risk-based approach what extra EDD measures, you need to take when dealing with that 
client. 
 
Where the client is a state-owned entity and the PEP in question is only a PEP due to 
their position in the State-Owned Entity, you may consider whether this mitigates the risks 
present. 
 
A useful source of further information is the FCA's guidance on the treatment of politically 
exposed persons for anti-money laundering purposes. The guidance is aimed at practices 
supervised by the FCA, but you should take it into account in accordance with 
R35(4)(b)(i). 
 
6.19.3.4 Senior management approval for onboarding a PEP 
 
R3(1) defines 'senior management' as: 
 
An  officer  or  employee  of  the  relevant  person  with sufficient  knowledge  of  the  relevant 
person's money laundering and terrorist financing risk exposure, and of sufficient authority to 
take decisions affecting its risk exposure. 
 

 
 
The FCA guidance referred to above sets out their view as to who, for the purposes of the 
Regulations, should be treated as coming within the definition of senior management. 
 
For legal practices, senior management may be: 
• a member of the board of directors or equivalent senior management team; 
• the head of a practice group or department or function; 
• a senior or managing partner; or 
• the MLRO or, if different, the MLCO. 
 
Other individuals may fall into this category depending on the nature and structure of your 
practice. 
 
Senior Management may delegate the application of their roles to other suitably senior 
and competent individuals however they remain ultimately responsible and accountable. 
You should advise those responsible for monitoring risk assessments that a business 
relationship with a PEP has begun, to help their overall monitoring of the practice's risk 
profile and compliance. 
 
For sole practitioners, you should appropriately record your decision e.g., as a conclusion 
to the client or matter risk assessment.
