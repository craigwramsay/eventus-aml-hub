6.14.5 Meeting clients face to face 
 
The following sources may be useful for verification of UK-based clients: 
 
• current, signed passport, driving license or birth certificate; 
• marriage certificate (e.g., particularly useful for evidencing name changes);  
• current government-issued identity card/certificate with photograph (e.g., gun license); 
• residence permit issued by the Home Office; 
• photographic registration cards for self-employed individuals and partnerships in 
the construction industry; 
• benefit book or original notification letter confirming the right to benefits; 
• a tax or utility bill or statement, or a certificate from a utility supplier confirming 
an arrangement to pre-pay for services; 
• a recent bank or mortgage statement/passbook from an FCA-regulated lender; 
• confirmation from an electoral register that a person of that name lives at that 
address; 
• land registry confirmation of address; 
• local council or housing association rent card or tenancy agreement; or 
• house or motor insurance certificate. 
 

 
 
Where you are provided with an electronic copy of a document (such as a downloaded 
bank statement) you should continue to take a risk-based approach while being conscious 
that its value as proof of address may be less than a standard hard copy. 
 
Part of the reason to accept documents such as a hard copy posted bank statement and 
letters from government agencies is to demonstrate that the individual has access to the 
property to which they were delivered. Part of that comfort is removed when print outs of 
electronic statements/bills are used.  This does not mean that such print- outs cannot be 
accepted but this loss of comfort should be considered on a risk sensitive basis.   
 
If documents are in a foreign language you should take appropriate steps to be 
satisfied that the documents in fact provide evidence of the client's identity and 
more generally that you understand what they say. Unless you have a sufficient 
level of understanding of the language, you should consider engaging the services 
of a translator. 
 
You should be mindful that some aspects of an individual’s identity (particularly 
name and/or sex) may change over time for entirely legitimate reasons, for 
example due to a change in sex or gender, or due to other life events such as a 
marriage or discretionary change of name. Such changes should not be used as a 
reason to withhold legal services in isolation, or necessarily interpreted as an 
indicator of higher AML risk  
 
6.14.6 Natural Persons not able to meet face to face  
 
In the case of persons you cannot meet face to face, consideration should be given to any 
geographic/jurisdictional (which could be at a regional or national level) risks this may 
present (see risk assessment section of this guidance for further information).  
 
The client's address may be identified or verified via: 
 
• an official overseas source; 
• a reputable directory; or 
• a person regulated to an equivalent standard for money laundering purposes in 
the country where the person is resident who confirms that the client is known to 
them and lives or works at the address given. 
 
When you do not meet the client, you should consider the reason for this and whether this 
represents an additional risk which should be taken into account in your risk assessment of 
the client and the extent of the due diligence measures you apply. EID&V may be a 
particularly useful tool in these circumstances. 
 
6.14.7 Clients unable to produce standard documentation 
Sometimes clients are unable to provide standard verification documents. The purpose of 
the Regulations is not to deny people access to legal services for legitimate transactions, 
but to mitigate the risk of legal services being used for the purposes of money laundering. 
You should consider whether the inability to provide you with standard verification is 
consistent with the client's profile and circumstances or whether it might make you 
suspicious that money laundering or terrorist financing is occurring. 
 

 
 
If you decide that a client has a good reason for not meeting the standard verification 
requirements, you may accept a letter from an appropriate person who knows the 
individual and can verify the client's identity. 
 
For example: 
• Clients in care homes might be able to provide a letter from the manager; 
• For elderly clients, you may be able to accept a letter from a General Medical 
Practitioner; 
• Clients without a permanent residence might be able to provide a letter from a 
householder named on a current council tax bill or a hostel manager, confirming 
temporary residence; 
• A refugee might be able to provide a letter from the Home Office confirming refugee 
status and granting permission to work, or a Home Office travel document for 
refugees; 
• An asylum seeker might be able to provide their registration card and any other 
identity documentation they hold, or a letter of assurance as to identity from a 
community member such as a religious official, GP, or local councillor who has 
knowledge of the client; 
• A student or minor might be able to provide a birth certificate and confirmation of 
their parent's address or confirmation of address from the register of the school or 
higher education institution; or 
• A person with mental health problems or mental incapacity might know medical 
workers, hostel staff, social workers, deputies or guardians appointed by the court 
who can locate identification documents or confirm the client's identity. 
 
6.14.8 Professionals 
 
Where other professionals use your services, in their capacity as a professional (e.g., when 
representing a client or on behalf of their practice) you may consider using Simplified Due 
Diligence as per R37. 
 
Where other professionals use your services in their capacity as a private individual, you 
will still need to complete full due diligence on them as you would with any other private 
individual. In order to verify their identity and business address you may consult their 
professional directory or register along with other sources. Being a regulated professional 
should not lead to automatic treatment as being low risk in all cases. 
 
You may consider the section on SDD in this context. 
 
6.14.9 Persons acting on behalf of the client 
 
In accordance with R28(10) where a person (the intermediary, agent or representative) 
purports to act on behalf of your client, you must: 
• verify that the intermediary, agent or representative is authorised to act on your 
client’s behalf (i.e., obtain written confirmation from your client); 
• identify the intermediary, agent or representative; and 
• verify the identity of the intermediary, agent or representative on the basis 
of documents and information from a reliable source which is independent 

 
 
of both the representative and the client e.g., via a copy of their passport or 
driving license. 
Someone employed by your client (depending on their position or seniority) or a 
director of your client may be considered as having apparent or ostensible 
authority to provide instructions on behalf of the client, though you may seek 
comfort of this on a risk sensitive basis.  They should not be considered to be 
intermediaries, agents or representatives. Where it is not clear or apparent what 
their authority to instruct on behalf of the client is, CDD should not be considered to 
be complete.  
For further information please also refer to 6.6 and 6.7. 
 
6.14.10 Non-natural persons 
 
R28(3A) states that where the customer is a legal person, trust, company, foundation or 
similar legal arrangement the relevant person must  (having identified and verified the 
customer in line with R28(2))  take reasonable measures to understand the ownership and 
control structure of that legal person, trust, company, foundation or similar legal 
arrangement. This is a wider concept than simply identifying the beneficial owners.  
“Reasonable measures” means taking steps that are risk-based, proportionate and effective 
in mitigating the identified money laundering and terrorism financing risks inherent in the 
client or matter being undertaken. When considering this test of reasonableness, you should 
consider whether the information is likely to assist in addressing the money laundering risks 
and that you are comfortable that you would be able to demonstrate and evidence the extent 
to which you have sought such information, to your supervisor upon request. It should not be 
misinterpreted as an allowance to not fulfil your duty to understand the overall ownership 
and control structure of the client.  
You should also bear in mind that under regulation 33(6)(a)(vi) corporate structures which 
are unusual or excessively complex given the nature of the company's business, are noted 
as a specific risk factor. This may in turn require enhanced due diligence which could 
include, among other things, seeking additional independent, reliable sources to verify 
information provided to you, pursuant to regulation 33(5)(a). 
Regulations 28(3) and (4) set out that you must obtain and verify the client’s registered 
details and, subject to Regulation 28(5), identify the beneficial owner (where there is one). 
You must also (subject to Regulation 28(5)) take reasonable measures to: 
• determine and verify the law to which the body corporate is subject, its constitution and 
the full names of its board of directors or equivalent, and the senior persons responsible 
for the operations of the body corporate; and 
• verify the identity of the any beneficial owner so that you are satisfied that you know who 
the beneficial owner is.  
  
Again, subject to Regulation 28(5), you must also take reasonable measures to understand 
the ownership and control structure of the client entity (as per R28(3A) noted above) and of 
the beneficial owner if it is a non-natural person. This does not simply mean looking at 
percentages of ownership but also identifying individuals with control and directing power, as 
outlined in regulations 5 and 6. You should document your overarching understanding of the 
individual’s background, circumstances and nature of the transaction. 
  

 
 
Under regulation 28(18)(a), “verify” means confirmation based on documents or information 
obtained from a reliable, independent source.  
 
Regulation 28(5) sets out the measures that do not apply where the client is a company 
listed on a regulated market. 
  
Under regulation 28(18)(b), documents issued by an official body are considered 
independent, even if provided or made available by the client or on their behalf. This might 
be significant, for example, where a register was only accessible to the client. 
Where applicable having regard to the circumstances, you should verify the identity of the 
beneficial owner(s) to the equivalent standards as that applied to clients who are natural 
persons, as described in 6.14 and/or 6.14.4. In other, lower risk situations and in limited 
circumstances (such as when the relevant person already knows and has previously verified 
the identity of the beneficial owner) taking reasonable measures to verify the beneficial 
owner may mean, for example, taking verification information from non-independent 
sources. To evidence why verification of beneficial owners through personal identity 
documents is not undertaken, it is important to document your overarching understanding of 
the individual’s background, circumstances and nature of the transaction. 
It is important to note that you are seeking to verify the beneficial owner’s identity, not simply 
that the identity in question is a beneficial owner. You may consider a range of sources to do 
this provided they are appropriate to the risk posed by the client or matter.   
Where you have been unable to verify the identity of the beneficial owners of a non-natural 
person, you should consider the reasons for this and whether this should lead to a disclosure 
to the NCA. Further consideration should be given to whether to act or continue to act for the 
client, particularly where the complexity of the structures is out of your normal scope of 
business or make completing CDD difficult. 
You should record all of your considerations as a part of the client or matter risk assessment, 
for more information see Section 5.
