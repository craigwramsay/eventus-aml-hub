participant, a cryptoasset exchange provider of the kind referred to in paragraph (7D)][

or (7E),

operations which appear to be linked.
(3)  A high value dealer must also apply customer due diligence measures if that dealer carries
out an occasional transaction in cash that amounts to 10,000 euros or more, whether the transaction
is executed in a single operation or in several operations which appear to be linked.
(4)  A transaction does not cease to be a “transaction in cash” for the purposes of paragraph (3)
if cash is paid by or on behalf of a party to the transaction—
(a)to a person other than the other party to the transaction for the benefit of the other party, or
(b)into a bank account for the benefit of the other party to the transaction.
(5)    A  casino  must  also  apply  customer  due  diligence  measures  in  relation  to  any  transaction
within paragraph (6) that amounts to 2,000 euros or more, whether the transaction is executed in a
single operation or in several operations which appear to be linked.
(6)  A transaction is within this paragraph if it consists of—

the casino;
(ii)payment  for  use  of  gaming  machines  (within  the  meaning  of  section  235  of  the

(iii)the deposit of funds required to take part in remote gambling; or
(b)the collection of winnings, including the withdrawal of funds deposited to take part in

paragraph  (5),  no  account  is  to  be  taken  of  winnings  from  a  previous  transaction  which  had  not
been collected from the casino, gaming machine or remote gambling, but are being re-used in the
transaction in question.
