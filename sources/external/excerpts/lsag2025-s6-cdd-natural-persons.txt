6.14 Methods of verification 
 
Verification should be completed on the basis of documents or information which come 
from a reliable source, independent of the client. There are a number of ways in which you 
may verify a client's identity including: 
 
• obtaining or viewing original documents from a trusted and independent source 
(public or private); 
• on a risk sensitive basis viewing copies of documents (certification of a copy may 
give you a higher level of confidence than an uncertified copy, but you should 
consider and document the risks of relying on certified copies for this);  
• conducting electronic verification, through a platform that is a reliable source (i.e., 
secure from fraud and misuse and capable of providing an appropriate level of 
assurance that the person claiming a particular identity is in fact the person with 
that identity, to a degree that is necessary for effectively managing and mitigating 
any risks of money laundering and terrorist financing); or 
• obtaining information from other regulated persons. 
 
6.14.1 Independent sources 
 
You need a reliable source(s) to verify your client’s identity, which is independent of the 
client e.g.  a passport or driver’s license, or, in the case of a corporate entity, evidence of 
registration from the relevant registry or reputable company services provider. 
 
You are permitted to use a wider range of sources when verifying the identity of the 
beneficial owner and understanding the ownership and control structure of the client.  
 
Sometimes only the client or their representatives will be able to provide you with this 
information. You may consider whether the documents or information should be certified as 
accurate by a professional regulated for AML to an equivalent standard.  
 
R28(9) confirms that the register of people with significant control, or the confirmation 
statement, which is published on the Companies House website, cannot be solely relied 
upon for the purpose of identifying or verifying the identity of the beneficial owner of a 
company or LLP client.  
 
The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA) brought in a 
number of changes to the way that companies are registered and what information must 
be declared on an ongoing basis. These increase the volume and detail required on 
registration and in annual returns. While this information will be very useful in assessing 
risk and completing due diligence, R28(9) is not affected.  
 
Remember, if you are not satisfied with the information you have on the identity of your 
client/beneficial owner, you should not undertake business with that client, (or cease 
business if an existing client) as per the requirements of R31. 
 
Documents should be in date if an expiry date is given, and recently dated (taking a risk-
based approach) if no expiry date is given. Expired documents should not be relied upon 
in the absence of any others but may be useful in support. 
 

 
 
6.14.2 Forged Documents 
 
You must not ignore obvious forgeries, but you are not required to be an expert in forged 
documents. You may however consider providing relevant employees with appropriate 
training and equipment to help identify forged documents where relevant to the processes 
of your practice where proportionate to the risk. 
 
You may make use of guidance on how to identify a forged document from the issuing 
body, or a similarly reputable source. For example, the Passport office issues such 
information, and current bill formats are available on utility provider websites.  
 
6.14.3 Electronic verification 
 
As technology has developed, use of electronic identification and verification (EID&V) tools 
have become more common. While you can never outsource your ultimate responsibility, 
EID&V tools can be useful in protecting your practice. 
 
R28 sets out minimum requirements for EID&V processes to be regarded as reliable sources 
in applying CDD.  
 
Test for whether you are able to use an EID&V tool 
 
Meeting the definitions in the (R2014/910/EU of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 23rd July 2014) as below 
 
Electronic identification - means the process of using person identification data in 
electronic form uniquely representing either a natural or legal person, or a natural 
person representing a legal person 
 
Trust service - means an electronic service normally provided for remuneration 
which consists of: 
(a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals 
or electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates 
related to those services; 
(b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; 
or 
(c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those 
services 
 
-and being secure from fraud, misuse and capable of providing an appropriate level 
of assurance that the person claiming a particular identity is in fact the person with 
that identity, to a degree that is necessary for effectively managing and mitigating 
any risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. 
 
 
There is further information available on this in Section 7. 
 

 
 
6.14.4 Natural persons 
The name, date of birth and current address of a natural person should all be identified 
and practices may use government photo-card identification (including passports or driving 
licenses) to verify these details. 
 
To do this you should obtain documents that verify name, address and date of birth, for 
example:  
 
• one government document which verifies name, address  and date of birth; or 
• a government document which verifies the client's full name and supporting 
documents which verifies their address and date of birth. 
 
You may consult a variety of documents to identify and verify your client. Where 
government-issued documents are not available, you may consider alternatives such as 
those set out at 6.14.7 below.   
The requirement to obtain suitable verification should not preclude access to legal services, 
especially to vulnerable, elderly or disadvantaged clients. In these situations, where it is not 
possible to obtain such documents, consider the reliability of other sources and the risks 
associated with the client and the matter. See the “Clients unable to produce standard 
documentation” section below. 
 
Where you are reasonably satisfied that an individual is nationally or internationally 
known, for example, because they are a public figure or a well-known celebrity (i.e., that 
you can confidently recognise them as the person they are purporting to be), a record of 
identification may include a file note of your satisfaction about identity, including an 
address. You should consider whether the individual may be a PEP, or family member 
or known close associate of a PEP.
