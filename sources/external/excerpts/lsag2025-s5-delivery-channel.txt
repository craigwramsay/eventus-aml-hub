5.6.4 Delivery Channel Risk 
 
Questions to ask when assessing 
inherent delivery channel risk for your 
PWRA. 
What % of its business is conducted on a 
non-face to face basis?  
Does the practice undertake work which 
is conducted through intermediaries or 
other 3rd parties? 
 
 
How you deliver your services must be considered in your PWRA. You should consider this 
along the following lines: 
• The proportion and characteristics of clients you do not meet face to face or do not 
verify with robust electronic identification and verification; (EID&V) 
• How many of your matters rely on indirect contact with your client (e.g., via a 
representative or agent) rather than holding a direct relationship with the client; 
• How much of your activity is delivered online or via any other channel that may 
facilitate anonymity; and 
• The methods used to undertake identification and verification and general due 
diligence requirements. 
5.6.4.1 Acting for individual clients without meeting them 
 
You should consider this as a risk factor when you carry out your PWRA. You should also 
consider how you mitigate the risk, for example by using an EID&V platform. It may also 
extend to the remote methods (e.g., telephone, email, live video) you use to contact your 
client, as not all methods provide the same level of anonymity. Contact that is limited to text-
only should be considered as higher risk. 
 
When you act for clients without meeting them you must be satisfied that it makes sense in 
all the circumstances that you have not met the client and you should be comfortable that 
you can mitigate the risks of identity fraud. You should consider whether any form of 
Enhanced Due Diligence may be appropriate. 
 
Use of an appropriate EID&V platform to mitigate the risks of not being able to meet a client 
can be helpful but is not in itself a guaranteed or automatic solution to these challenges. A 
clear understanding of the limitations of such tools is needed if they are to be used correctly. 
See Section 7 for more information on this.
