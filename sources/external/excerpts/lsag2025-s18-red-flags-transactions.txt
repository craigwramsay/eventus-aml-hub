18.3 The Nature of the Transaction 
 
• Transactions involving jurisdictions with strict bank secrecy and confidentiality rules, 
without similar money laundering requirements; 
• use of shell companies which may be indicated by: 
o formal nominees and informal nominees, such as children, spouses, relatives or 
associates who do not appear to be involved in the running of the corporate 
enterprise; 
o address of mass registration; 
o only a post-box address; 
o no real business activities being undertaken; 
o the exclusive transit of transactions with no wealth or income being generated; 
o no personnel (or only a single person as a staff member); 
o lack of payment of taxes, superannuation, retirement fund contributions or social 
benefits; 
o no physical presence; 
• loss-making transactions where the loss is avoidable or readily accepted;  

 
 
• dealing with money or property where you suspect that either is being transferred to 
avoid the attention of a trustee in a bankruptcy case, HMRC, or a law enforcement 
agency;  
• transactions which appear to be complex or unusually large;  
• unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic purpose; 
• transactions are unusual because of their size, nature, frequency or manner of 
execution; 
• significant differences between the declared price and the approximate actual values 
as judged either by the legal professional or in respect to some reference; 
• type of operation being conducted is clearly inconsistent with the size, age, or activity 
of the legal entity or natural person acting; 
• creation of complicated ownership structures; 
• involvement of structures with multiple countries where there is no apparent link to 
the client or transaction; 
• incorporation and/or purchase of stock or securities of several companies, 
enterprises or legal entities within a short period of time with elements in common;  
• there is an absence of documentation to support the client’s story, previous 
transactions, or company activities; 
• there are several elements in common between a number of transactions in a short 
period of time; 
• back-to-back property transactions (for example, within six months), with rapidly 
increasing value or purchase price;  
• abortive transactions with no concern for the fee level or after receipt of funds;  
• the retainer exclusively relates to keeping documents or other goods, holding large 
deposits of money or otherwise using the client account; 
• a lack of sensible commercial/financial/tax or legal reason for the transaction;  
• a power of attorney is sought for the administration or disposal of assets under 
conditions which are unusual; 
• investment in immovable property, in the absence of any links with the place where 
the property is located and/or of any financial advantage from the investment;   
• services where legal professionals, effectively acting as financial intermediaries, 
handle the receipt and transmission of funds through accounts they control in the act 
of facilitating a business transaction;  
• services that allow clients to deposit/transfer funds through the legal professional’s 
trust account that are not tied to a transaction which the legal professional is 
performing;  
• services where the client may request financial transactions to occur outside of the 
legal professional’s trust account;  
• services requested by the client for which the legal professional does not have 
expertise unless the legal professional is referring the request to an appropriately 
trained professional for advice; 
• services that rely heavily on new technologies that may have inherent vulnerabilities 
to exploitation by criminals, especially those not regulated for AML/CFT;  
• transfer of real estate or other high value goods or assets between parties in a time 
period that is unusually short for similar transactions with no apparent legal, tax, 
business, economic or other legitimate reason;  
• payments received from un-associated or unknown third parties and payments in 
cash where this would not be a typical method of payment; 
• transactions where it is readily apparent to the legal professional that there is 
inadequate consideration, especially where the client does not provide legitimate 
reasons for the amount of the consideration; 

 
 
• administrative arrangements concerning estates where the deceased was known to 
the legal professional as being a person who had been convicted of crimes that 
generated proceeds;  
• unexplained establishment of unusual provisions in credit arrangements that do not 
reflect the commercial position between the parties;  
• transfer of goods that are inherently difficult to value, where this is not common for 
the type of client, transaction or the legal professional’s normal course of business; 
• acquisitions of businesses in liquidation with no apparent legal, tax, business, 
economic or other legitimate reason;  
• services where the legal professional acts as a trustee/director that allows the client’s 
identity to remain anonymous; or 
• commercial, private or real property transactions or services to be carried out by the 
client with no apparent legitimate business, economic, tax, family governance, or 
legal reasons.  
18.4 Trusts and Administration of Estates 
 
• Purpose of the trust is unclear (trusts can be used to evade tax and hide criminal 
property); 
• unusual structure or jurisdiction;  
• unexplained use of express trusts, and/or incongruous or unexplained relationships 
between beneficiaries and the settlor; 
• settlor was accused or convicted of acquisitive criminal conduct, improperly claimed 
welfare benefits or had evaded the due payment of tax during their lifetime; 
• assets earned or obtained in a high-risk jurisdiction; 
• unexplained or incongruous classes of beneficiaries in a trust; or 
• discrepancy between the supposed wealth of the settlor and the object of the 
settlement.  
18.5 Property work  
 
18.5.1 Ownership issues 
 
• Properties owned by nominee companies or multiple owners may be used as money 
laundering vehicles to disguise the true owner and/or confuse the audit trail; or 
• sudden or unexplained changes in ownership. (Flipping, involves a property 
purchase, often using someone else’s identity which is then quickly sold for a much 
higher price to the same buyer using another identity. The proceeds of crime are 
mixed with mortgage funds for the purchase. This process may be repeated several 
times.) 
18.5.2 Funding Methods 
 
• Transactions that do not involve a mortgage have a higher risk of being fraudulent, 
though a payment being made through the mainstream banking system is not 
guaranteed to be clean;  
• large payments from private funds, especially if your client has a low income and 
payments from a number of individuals or sources;  
• funds are supplied by a third party; or 
• checks on the source of the funding can be more difficult where they involve direct 
payments between buyers and sellers. 

 
 
18.5.3 Valuing 
 
• A significant discrepancy between the sale price and what would reasonably be 
expected for such a property to sell for.  
18.5.4 Lender issues 
  
• A client may attempt to mislead a lender client to improperly inflate a mortgage 
advance – for example, by misrepresenting the borrower’s income or because the 
seller and buyer are conspiring to overstate the sale price.  This is mortgage fraud, 
and the mortgage advance will be the proceeds of crime; or 
• loans which are not at arms’ length may require particularly close consideration.  
 
18.5.5 Tax issues 
  
• If the purchase price is recorded incorrectly, this may be in an attempt to evade 
stamp duty (the saving would represent the proceeds of crime.) 
 
18.5.6 Charities 
 
• If registered with the Charity Commission, a charity is likely to be lower risk; 
• if you are asked to receive money on the charity's behalf from an individual or a 
company donor, or a bequest from an estate, be alert to unusual circumstances 
including large sums of money; or 
• there is growing concern about the use of charities for terrorist funding. HM Treasury 
maintains a consolidated list of individuals and entities to whom you may not provide 
funds, economic resources, and in relation to terrorism, financial services.  
18.6 Company and Commercial Work   
 
18.6.1 Formation of private equity funds  
 
• Generally private equity work will be considered at low risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing. Factors which may alter this risk assessment include:   
 
o where the private equity sponsor or an investor is located in a jurisdiction which is 
not regulated for money laundering to a standard which is equivalent to the 4th 
Directive;  
o where the investor is either an individual or an investment vehicle itself; or 
o where the private equity sponsor is seeking to raise funds for the first time.  
 
• Whether an unregulated private entity firm, fund manager or other person involved 
with the transaction is an appropriate source of information regarding beneficial 
ownership of the client should be determined on a risk-based approach. Issues to 
consider include: 
 
o the profile of the private equity sponsor, fund manager, or such other person;  
o their track record within the private equity sector; or 
o their willingness to explain identification procedures and provide confirmation that 
all beneficial ownerships have been identified.  

 
 
18.6.2 Collective investment schemes 
 
The risk associated with a collective investment scheme may be decreased where:   
• the scheme is only open to tax-exempt institutional investors;  
• investment managers are regulated individuals or entities; or 
• a prospectus is issued to invite investment.  
 
Factors which will increase the risks include where:   
• the scheme is open to non-tax-exempt investors;  
• the scheme or its investors are located in a jurisdiction which is not regulated for 
money laundering to a standard which is not equivalent to the currently applicable EU 
directive; or 
• neither the scheme nor the investment managers are regulated and do not conduct
