6.14.12 Trusts 
 
These obligations set out below, apply to all trusts including will trusts and personal injury 
trusts.  
 

 
 
6.14.12.1 Who is the client? 
 
In the UK, trusts do not have legal personality. As such, a trust cannot be your client. 
When advising in relation to a trust, your client may be: 
 
• the settlor; 
• the trustee(s); 
• the protector(s); or 
• one or more of the beneficiaries. 
 
Your client(s) will be the person to whom you owe your duty of care and who will receive 
the benefit of your advice. 
 
Where an express trust has yet to be established and you are providing tax or 
transactional advice to a prospective settlor in anticipation of creating a trust, your client 
will usually be the settlor. Your responsibilities to verify the identity of the client and their 
source of funds, is then no different to any other client, except that you will also need to 
understand the nature and extent of the assets that will be settled on the trust. 
 
6.14.12.2 Specific CDD requirements when instructed in relation to an existing trust 
 
Where you are instructed in relation to an existing trust, when applying CDD: you must 
obtain and verify the identity of your client including beneficial owners where applicable: 
 
• where you act for several beneficiaries (subject to conflicts issues), you must 
obtain and verify the identity of each of them, unless you are acting for them as 
a class (in which case you should identify the class by its name); 
• you must, where your client has had a trust funding role, understand your client’s 
source of wealth and the source of funds which were contributed (or which were 
used to acquire assets which were contributed) to the trust; 
• you must understand the nature and extent of the assets settled on the trust; and 
• you must understand and record the identity of the (non-client) settlor, trustee(s), 
protector(s), and/or beneficiary(is) and any person who otherwise has control of 
the trust, as trust beneficial owners. 
 
If the trust is a relevant trust for registration, you must also identify potential 
beneficiaries. 
 
If, when you carried out CDD in relation to a trust (or legal entity/arrangement other 
than a body corporate) the beneficiaries were designated as a class you must 
establish and verify the identity of any beneficiary before you are involved in the 
payment to, or exercising of rights of, a specified beneficiary.  
 
When applying CDD to a trust, or any other legal arrangement/entity which is not a 
company, involving a class of beneficiaries, you must always verify the identity of the 
beneficiary or beneficiaries before any payment is made to them or they exercise their 
vested rights in the trust or legal entity/arrangement (R 30 (7)). 
 

 
 
6.14.12.3 CDD where the identified client (i.e., the trustee or the settlor) of a trust is an entity  
 
If the identified beneficial owner is an entity, you may need to understand who its 
ultimate beneficial owners are, depending on the entity's status (e.g., whether it is a 
company or some other type of entity).  
 
The extent of the measures you take to identify the ultimate beneficial owner of one of the 
trust’s defined ‘beneficial owners’ will depend on its role in relation to the trust. The ultimate 
beneficial owner of a settlor, protector or sole beneficiary entity should be fully identified. 
 
6.14.12.4 Who is a ‘beneficiary’ for the purposes of CDD where you act in relation to trusts? 
 
R6(1) implies that individual beneficiaries need not be identified in CDD unless it has been 
determined that they will benefit from the trust. That is, unless and until they have a vested 
interest in the capital of the trust. 
 
If you do not note all individual beneficiaries named in the trust deed or any associated 
document on the basis that their benefit from the trust has not yet been determined, you 
must identify any named class of beneficiaries, by its description. For example: 
 
• grandchildren of [X]; or 
• charity [Y]. 
 
As CDD can only take account of circumstances at a point in time, you should note the 
names of all discretionary beneficiaries (including those who have yet to acquire determined 
interests) named in the trust deed and any document from the settlor relating to the trust, 
such as a letter of wishes. Their interests may vest (or otherwise be determined) while you 
are acting in relation to the trust, thus bringing them within the group of individuals who need 
to be noted in CDD as beneficiaries, as defined in R6(1)(c). 
 
When considering the identity of those in whose main interest a trust is set up or 
operates and there are several classes of beneficiary, consider which class is most 
likely to receive most of the trust property. For example: 
 
• where a trust is for the issue of [X], then the class is the issue of [X] as there is only 
one class; 
• where a trust is for the children of [X], if they all die, for the grandchildren of [X] 
and if they all die for charity [Y], then the class is likely to be the children of [X] as 
it is unlikely that they will all die before the funds are disbursed; or 
• where a discretionary trust allows for payments to the widow, the children, their 
spouses and civil partners, the grandchildren and their spouses and civil partners 
then all interests are equal, and all classes will need to be identified. 
 
When in doubt about which class has the main interest, you should identity all 
classes. 
 
However, where you act in relation to a discretionary trust, if you decide against noting in 
your CDD the names of individual beneficiaries who are named in the trust deed or any 
associated document on the basis that their benefitting from the trust has not yet been 
determined, you will need to seek regular updates from your client, as part of your on-going 

 
 
monitoring measures on a risk-based approach. This may include when and whether 
beneficiaries’ interests in the trust will be or have been determined. 
 
The wider approach, involving noting all beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries named 
in the trust deed and any associated document at CDD outset, may therefore be 
preferable from the outset. 
6.14.12.5 What does ‘an individual who has control over the trust’ mean? 
R6(1)(e) brings any individual who has control over the trust within the definition of 
the beneficial owners of a trust and they will therefore need to be identified when you 
act in relation to a trust. 
 
R6(2) defines control as a power, whether exercisable alone, jointly or with the consent of 
another, under the trust instrument or by law to: 
 
• dispose of, advance, lend, invest, pay or apply trust property; 
• vary or terminate the trust; 
• add or remove a person as a beneficiary or to or from a class of beneficiaries; 
• appoint or remove trustees or give another individual control over the trust; or 
• direct, withhold consent to or veto the exercise of one of the above powers. 
 
R6(4)(b) specifically excludes from the definition of an individual who has control over a 
trust an individual ('P') who has control solely as a result of: 
 
• P's consent being required in accordance with section 32(1)(c) (power of 
advancement) of the Trustee Act 1925; 
• any discretion delegated to P under section 34 (power of investment and 
delegation) of the Pensions Act 1995; 
• the power to give a direction conferred on P by section 19(2) (appointment and 
retirement of trustee at instance of beneficiaries) of the Trusts of Land and 
Appointment of Trustees Act 1996; or 
• the power exercisable collectively at common law to vary or extinguish a trust 
where the beneficiaries under the trust are of full age and capacity and (taken 
together) absolutely entitled to the property subject to the trust (or, in Scotland, 
have a full and unqualified right to the fee). 
 
6.14.12.6 CDD implications arising from the register of beneficial owners of taxable relevant trusts 
 
If you or your practice on occasions acts as (as opposed to for) a trustee of a taxable 
relevant trust, pursuant to R44 of the Regulations you will need to maintain accurate and 
up to date records of all beneficial owners and potential beneficiaries of the trust. 
 
Even if your practice is also acting for the trustee(s) and has applied CDD, this may involve 
you in more extensive investigations. 
 
A taxable relevant trust is: 
 
• a UK express trust, meaning that either all the trustees are resident in the UK or 
at least one trustee is UK resident and the settlor was UK resident and domiciled 
when the trust was set up or when the settlor added funds to it; or 

 
 
• any other (non-UK) express trust which, in any tax year, becomes liable to pay 
one or more of UK income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land 
tax, land and buildings transaction tax or stamp duty reserve tax in relation to UK 
income or assets. 
 
If you form a business relationship in your role as trustee with a relevant person, which 
could be an advisory relationship with your practice (if it is subject to the Regulations), 
you will need to inform the relevant person that you are acting as a trustee and, on 
request, provide the relevant person with information identifying the trust’s beneficial 
owners and potential beneficiaries. 
 
That obligation lies on (external) trustees of relevant trusts who enter into transactions in 
relation to which you or your practice are required to apply CDD or who form a business 
relationship with you or your practice (if you are subject to the Regulations). This should 
assist you in your compliance with your CDD obligations and is another reason why it 
makes sense to extend your CDD in relation to a relevant trust's beneficial owners also to 
cover potential beneficiaries. 
 
Otherwise, from a reputational risk and advisory perspective, as law enforcement 
authorities may gain access to information not only about the trust’s beneficial owners as 
defined in R6(1) but also the names of those individuals who are referred to in any 
document from the settlor, such as a letter of wishes, relating to the trust, it is prudent to 
note such wider information in your CDD records where you act for any client in relation to 
a relevant trust, and where you act in relation to any trust. 
6.14.12.7 Practical considerations of CDD for trusts 
 
Applying CDD where you act in relation to an existing trust should generally involve your 
having sight of the trust deed or documents which relates to it and obtaining an 
appropriate understanding of their content. In some circumstances, this understanding of 
the content may come from an explanatory note provided by another professional 
regulated for AML to a similar standard. The rationale for obtaining such evidence in this 
manner should be documented. 
 
In low-risk situations (as determined by appropriate and thorough documented risk 
assessment) you may be able to record an account of the terms of the trust given by the 
client or another regulated person who has had an involvement with setting up or 
managing the trust. However, before doing so, you should be assured that the reason for 
your not being provided with the trust deed and any document which relates to it makes 
sense in all circumstances, is recorded by you and is not indicative of a higher risk of 
money laundering. 
 
You will also need to assure yourself that in identifying the trust’s beneficial owners, the 
client or other regulated person, as appropriate, had proper regard to whether they 
included any individual (other than the settlor, the trustees and the beneficiaries) who has 
control over the trust, and potential beneficiaries.
