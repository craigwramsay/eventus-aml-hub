6.19 When to apply EDD 
 
6.19.1 High-risk third countries 
 
You must apply EDD measures in any business relationship with a person established 
in a HRTC or where you are undertaking an occasional transaction (within the meanings 
of R27(1)(b) and (2)) where either party is established in a high-risk third country.  
 
HRTCs are defined by the Regulations as High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for 
Action or Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring by FATF.   
 
Being “established in” a country means: 
• in the case of a legal person, being incorporated in or having a principal place 
of business (head office) in that country, or for a financial institution having its 
main regulator in that country; or 
• in the case of a natural person, being resident in that country but not 
necessarily simply having been born in that country. 
However, this requirement does not apply if: 
 
• the client is a branch or majority owned subsidiary of an entity which is a third 
country and the entity is subject to requirements equivalent to the 5
th
 Money 
Laundering Directive and supervised for compliance with those requirements; 
• it complies with the group wide policies established by the entity under Article 45 
of the Directive, and 
• you do not consider EDD measures to be necessary taking a risk-based 
approach. 
 
Note that not all countries where there may be a higher risk of money laundering are 'high-
risk third countries' for these purposes. Other jurisdictions may equally pose higher ML 
risks – these should be assessed as part of client and matter risk assessments, and 
additional, enhanced due diligence measures should be applied accordingly. 
 
6.19.2 Other situations of higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing 
 
Enhanced due diligence is also required where there is a higher risk of money laundering 
or terrorist financing. In determining whether there is a higher risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing in a given case, you must consider the risk factors set out in R33(6), 
along with the outcomes of your practice-wide, client and matter risk assessments.  
 
Instances of high risk as detailed in your supervisor’s risk assessment and in the National 
Risk Assessment also require EDD to be applied. 
 
Please see the features outlined in Section 5 and 18 of this guidance for further 
information. You should consider the situation in context of the CDD information held on 
your client, including their background and financial circumstances. 
 
 
Regulation 33(6) – Risk Factors you must consider when determining whether to 
apply EDD 

 
 
 
When assessing whether there is a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing in 
a particular situation, and the extent of the measures which should be taken to manage 
and mitigate that risk, relevant persons must take account of risk factors including, 
among other things—  
 
(a)customer risk factors, including whether—  
(i) the business relationship is conducted in unusual circumstances;  
(ii) the customer is resident in a geographic area of high risk (see sub-paragraph (c));  
(iii) the customer is a legal person or legal arrangement that is a vehicle for holding 
personal assets;  
(iv) the customer is a company that has nominee shareholders or shares in bearer form;  
(v) the customer is a business that is cash intensive;  
(vi) the corporate structure of the customer is unusual or excessively complex given the 
nature of the company’s business;  
(vii) the customer is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy; o 
(viii) the customer is a third country national who is applying for residence rights in or 
citizenship of an EEA state in exchange for transfers of capital, purchase of a property, 
government bonds or investment in corporate entities in that EEA state; 
 
(b)product, service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors, including whether—  
(i) the product involves private banking;  
(ii) the product or transaction is one which might favour anonymity;  
(iii) the situation involves non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, without 
certain safeguards, such as an electronic identification process which meets the 
conditions set out in regulation 28(19);  
(iv) payments will be received from unknown or un-associated third parties;  
(v) new products and new business practices are involved, including new delivery 
mechanisms, and the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-
existing products;  
(vi) the service involves the provision of nominee directors, nominee shareholders or 
shadow directors, or the formation of companies in a third country;  
(vii) there is a transaction related to oil, arms, precious metals, tobacco products, cultural 
artefacts, ivory or other items related to protected species, or other items of 
archaeological, historical, cultural or religious significance or of rare scientific value 
 
(c) geographic risk factors, including—  
(i) countries identified by credible sources, such as FATF mutual evaluations, detailed 
assessment reports or published follow-up reports, as not having effective systems to 
counter money laundering or terrorist financing;  
(ii) countries identified by credible sources as having significant levels of corruption or 
other criminal activity, such as terrorism (within the meaning of section 1 of the Terrorism 
Act 2000(86)), money laundering, and the production and supply of illicit drugs;  
(iii) countries subject to sanctions, embargos or similar measures issued by, for example, 
the European Union or the United Nations;  
(iv) countries providing funding or support for terrorism;  
(v) countries that have organisations operating within their territory which have been 
designated—  
(aa) by the government of the United Kingdom as proscribed organisations under 
Schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000(87), or  
(bb) by other countries, international organisations or the European Union as terrorist 
organisations; and 
(vi) countries identified by credible sources, such as evaluations, detailed assessment 
reports or published follow-up reports published by the Financial Action Task Force, the 

 
 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development or other international bodies or non-governmental 
organisations as not implementing requirements to counter money laundering and 
terrorist financing that are consistent with the recommendations published by the 
Financial Action Task Force in February 2012 and updated in June 2019. 
 
As well as considering the risks identified above, you should have regard to any of the risk 
factors discussed in Section 5 that may be present in a given client or matter.
