# LSAG AML Guidance 2025 - Red Flags and Suspicious Activity Indicators
# Chapter 18 (Sections 18.1 - 18.10)
# Source: lsag-aml-guidance-23-april-2025.pdf

18.1 General Overview 
 
The Regulations require you to conduct risk assessments, due diligence and ongoing 
monitoring of your business relationships and take steps to be aware of transactions with 
heightened money laundering or counter-terrorist financing risks. The Proceeds of Crime Act 
2002 requires you to report suspicious transactions. 
 
This section highlights a number of warning signs or “red flags” for legal professionals 
generally and for those dealing with particular types of work, to further help you assess the 
AML risks associated with your practice, or risks of a particular client or matter appropriately 
and also to help you decide whether you have reasons for concern or the basis for a 
reportable suspicion.  
 
Because money launderers are always developing new techniques, no list of examples can 
be exhaustive or fully comprehensive; however, below are some key factors which may arise 
during or after client and retainer acceptance and give you cause for concern.  
 
If you become aware of a red flag, this should prompt to you to ask for additional 
documentation or ask further questions of your client.  For any aspect of an instruction, good 
questions to ask are, “Does this make sense?” and, “Is the documentation I have consistent 
with what I am being told and know about the background, nature or circumstances of the 
client?”  If the answer is no, then consider what further information or documentation you 
require in order to become satisfied. If you cannot be satisfied, you consider your position in 
terms of proceeding with the relationship or matter, as per r.30., and consider the 
submission of a suspicious activity report.  
 
The presence of any one red flag does not mean that a client is automatically high risk, that 
you should not continue with the retainer or that you need to make a Suspicious Activity 
Report. The presence of red flags must be considered in context; the client may be able to 
provide a legitimate explanation.  For example, a large transaction by an oil company points 
to high risk, but actually it may be a normal and regular occurrence for that particular client’s 
industry and business activities, and for your law firm.  Remember, it is not “tipping off” to 
ask for further information as part of your client due diligence process.  
 
If you cannot get the information you need, this may in itself be cause for further concern 
and lead you to become suspicious. 
 
18.2 Examples of Red Flags 
 
In collating these red flags, reference has been made to The FATF Report on Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Vulnerabilities of Legal Professionals (2013) and The 
FATF Guidance on Concealment of Beneficial Ownership (July 2018) as well as other, 
similar pieces of guidance.
