Enhanced customer due diligence: politically exposed persons
35.—(1)    A  relevant  person  must  have  in  place  appropriate  risk-management  systems  and
procedures to determine whether a customer or the beneficial owner of a customer is—
(a)a politically exposed person (a “PEP”); or
(b)a family member or a known close associate of a PEP,
and  to  manage  the  enhanced  risks  arising  from  the  relevant  person's  business  relationship  or
transactions with such a customer.
(2)    In  determining  what  risk-management  systems  and  procedures  are  appropriate  under
paragraph (1), the relevant person must take account of—
(a)the risk assessment it carried out under regulation 18(1);
(b)the level of risk of money laundering and terrorist financing inherent in its business;
(c)the extent to which that risk would be increased by its business relationship or transactions
with a PEP, or a family member or known close associate of a PEP, and
(d)any relevant information made available to the relevant person under regulations 17(9)
and 47.
(3)  If a relevant person has determined that a customer or a potential customer is a PEP, or a
family member or known close associate of a PEP, the relevant person must assess—
(a)the level of risk associated with that customer, and
(b)the extent of the enhanced customer due diligence measures to be applied in relation to
that customer.
[
F165
(3A)    For  the  purpose  of  the  relevant  person’s  assessment  under  paragraph  (3),  where  a
customer or potential customer is a domestic PEP, or a family member or a known close associate
of a domestic PEP—
(a)the starting point for the assessment is that the customer or potential customer presents a
lower level of risk than a non-domestic PEP, and
(b)if  no  enhanced  risk  factors  are  present,  the  extent  of  enhanced  customer  due  diligence
measures to be applied in relation to that customer or potential customer is less than the
extent to be applied in the case of a non-domestic PEP.]

(4)  In assessing the extent of the enhanced customer due diligence measures to be taken in relation
to any particular person (which may differ from case to case), a relevant person—
(a)must take account of any relevant information made available to the relevant person under
regulations 17(9) and 47; and
(b)may take into account any guidance which has been—
(i)issued by the FCA; or
(ii)issued by any other supervisory authority or appropriate body and approved by the
Treasury.
(5)  A relevant person who proposes to have, or to continue, a business relationship with a PEP,
or a family member or a known close associate of a PEP, must, in addition to the measures required
by regulation 33—
(a)have  approval  from  senior  management  for  establishing  or  continuing  the  business
relationship with that person;
(b)take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds which are
involved in the proposed business relationship or transactions with that person; and
(c)where the business relationship is entered into, conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of
the business relationship with that person.
(6)    A  relevant  person  which  is  providing  a  customer  with  a  contract  of  long-term  insurance
(an “insurance policy”) must take reasonable measures to determine whether one or more of the
beneficiaries of the insurance policy or the beneficial owner of a beneficiary of such an insurance
policy are—
(a)PEPs, or
(b)family members or known close associates of PEPs.
(7)  The measures required under paragraph (6) must be taken before—
(a)any payment is made under the insurance policy, or
(b)the benefit of the insurance policy is assigned in whole or in part to another person.
(8)  A relevant person must, in addition to the measures required by regulation 33, ensure that—
(a)its senior management is informed before it pays out any sums under an insurance policy
the beneficiary of which is a PEP or a person who comes within paragraph (6)(b) in relation
to a PEP, and
(b)its entire business relationship with the holder of the insurance policy (“the policy holder”)
is scrutinised on an ongoing basis in accordance with enhanced procedures, whether or
not the policy holder is a PEP or a family member or known close associate of a PEP.
(9)  Where a person who was a PEP is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function,
a relevant person must continue to apply the requirements in paragraphs (5) and (8) in relation to
that person—
(a)for a period of at least 12 months after the date on which that person ceased to be entrusted
with that public function; or
(b)for  such  longer  period  as  the  relevant  person  considers  appropriate  to  address  risks  of
money laundering or terrorist financing in relation to that person.
(10)  Paragraph (9) does not apply in relation to a person who—
(a)was not a politically exposed person within the meaning of regulation 14(5) of the Money
Laundering Regulations 2007 
M76
, when those Regulations were in force; and
(b)ceased to be entrusted with a prominent public function before the date on which these
Regulations come into force.

(11)  When a person who was a PEP is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function, the
relevant person is no longer required to apply the requirements in paragraphs (5) and (8) in relation
to a family member or known close associate of that PEP (whether or not the period referred to in
paragraph (9) has expired).
(12)  In this regulation—
(a)“politically  exposed  person”  or  “PEP”  means  an  individual  who  is  entrusted  with
prominent public functions, other than as a middle-ranking or more junior official;
(b)“family member” of a politically exposed person includes—
(i)a spouse or civil partner of the PEP;
(ii)children of the PEP and the spouses or civil partners of the PEP's children;
(iii)parents of the PEP;
(c)“known close associate” of a PEP means—
(i)an individual known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or a legal
arrangement or any other close business relations with a PEP;
(ii)an  individual  who  has  sole  beneficial  ownership  of  a  legal  entity  or  a  legal
arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a PEP;
[

(d)
“domestic  PEP”  means  a  politically  exposed  person  entrusted  with  prominent  public

(e)“non-domestic PEP” means a politically exposed person who is not a domestic PEP;
(f)“enhanced risk factors”, in relation to a customer or potential customer who is a domestic
PEP or a family member or a known close associate of that domestic PEP, mean risk factors
other than the customer’s or potential customer’s position as a domestic PEP or as a family
member or a known close associate of that domestic PEP.]
(13)  For the purposes of paragraph (5), a reference to a business relationship with an individual
includes a reference to a business relationship with a person of which the individual is a beneficial
owner.
