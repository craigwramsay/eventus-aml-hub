# LSAG AML Guidance 2025 - Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
# Sections 6.1 - 6.16
# Source: lsag-aml-guidance-23-april-2025.pdf

6.1 General Comments  
 
Undertaking appropriate Client Due Diligence (CDD) is required under R27, and is one of the 
key controls you have, to protect your practice from Money Laundering and Terrorism 
Financing (ML/TF) risks. 
 
CDD is the collective term for the checks you must do on your clients, which may differ 
depending on the circumstances. It is holistic in nature and is wider than simply 
undertaking identification and verification of clients. 
 
Aside from any specific CDD requirements you must take under the Regulations, the 
amount, type and level of CDD undertaken should reflect and mitigate the nature of 
particular risks inherent in each client, transaction or matter.  
 

 
 
Practices must be able to demonstrate to their supervisory authority that these CDD 
measures are appropriate in mitigation of these risks, by recording their reasoning and 
actions in this regard. 
 
Useful information in regard to understanding the nature and purpose of a relationship may 
include:  
• The nature and details of the business/occupation/employment; 
• Source of funds and source of wealth information; or 
• Anticipated levels and nature of activity to be conducted. 
Beyond adherence to the Regulations, there is a natural incentive for practices to establish 
with confidence who their client is and the details of any transaction they are involved in or 
facilitating. It will protect them from unintentionally facilitating a range of financial crimes or 
being defrauded themselves. 
 
Identifying and verifying clients, is also essential for a practice to be able to accurately report 
suspicious activity to the National Crime Agency (NCA), identify Politically Exposed Persons 
(PEPs) or other high-risk individuals, and ensure the practice is not undertaking business in 
breach of applicable sanctions regimes. 
 
In relation to CDD, the Policies, Controls and Procedures (PCPs) of your firm should be set 
out clearly, in writing in a way that is accessible to all relevant staff in your practice. 
 
6.2 Long-standing/Personal Relationships 
 
There is no provision in the Regulations for waiving CDD requirements on the basis of long-
standing or personal relationships. Taking this approach will not satisfy the requirement to 
undertake independent verification, though these factors may inform your risk-based 
approach. 
 
6.3 Application of CDD 
 
You are required to apply CDD for services in scope of the Regulations when: 
 
• establishing a business relationship; 
• carrying out an occasional transaction that amounts to a transfer of funds within 
the meaning of Article 3.9 of the Funds Transfer Regulation (Regulation (EU) 
2015/847)
 exceeding 1,000 Euros; 
 
(9) ‘transfer of funds’ means any transaction at least partially carried out by electronic means on behalf of a 
payer through a payment service provider, with a view to making funds available to a payee through a 
payment service provider, irrespective of whether the payer and the payee are the same person and 
irrespective of whether the payment service provider of the payer and that of the payee are one and the 
same, including:  
(a)  a credit transfer as defined in point (1) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012;  
(b)  a direct debit as defined in point (2) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012;  
(c)  a money remittance as defined in point (13) of Article 4 of Directive 2007/64/EC, whether national or cross 
border;  
(d)  a transfer carried out using a payment card, an electronic money instrument, or a mobile phone, or any 
other digital or IT prepaid or post-paid device with similar characteristics;   

 
 
• carrying out an occasional transaction that amounts to 15,000 Euros or more, 
whether it is executed in a single operation or in several operations which appear 
to be linked; 
• you suspect money laundering or terrorist financing; or 
• you doubt the veracity or adequacy of documents or information previously 
obtained for the purposes of identification or verification. 
The Regulations as amended prescribe further situations where you must re-apply CDD for 
existing clients. These arise when you have any legal duty in the course of the calendar year 
to contact a client to review information: 
 
• relevant to your client risk assessment (or practice-wide/matter risk assessment as 
appropriate); or 
• concerning beneficial ownership information of the customer, including information 
which helps you understand the ownership or control structure of any entity that is 
the beneficial owner of the client. 
 
The duty also arises where a practice has a duty to contact the client under the International 
Tax Compliance Regulations 2015. 
 
6.4 Definition of Business Relationship 
There may be several indicators that a client is establishing a business relationship, as 
opposed to the matter being an “occasional transaction” including but not limited to: 
• an explicit expectation from the client or practice that a business relationship is 
being established; 
• the nature of the client or the transaction suggests they may wish to undertake 
more than one transaction e.g., it is in the nature of their business;  
• or the transaction itself will inherently take time to complete e.g., the 
buying/selling of real property. 
 
The definition of business relationship under the Regulations requires the legal 
practitioner to have an expectation at the time the contact is established, that the 
relationship will have “an element of duration” (R4). This should be interpreted in the 
broadest sense, as it is reasonable to assume that any legal professional will have an 
expectation of possible further business from any initial contact made with a client. 
When dealing with a client for the first time, you should assume that a business 
relationship is being formed unless you have explicit reasons to know that this is not 
the case i.e., that there will not be an “element of duration.”  
 
The nature of the relationship should be recorded in the client risk assessment. Any 
reasons for not applying CDD must be clearly recorded and this will in practice be in 
the rarest of exceptions. 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, any company formation on behalf of a client immediately 
implies the establishment of a business relationship as per R4(2). 
 
6.5 Definition of an occasional transaction 
 
A transaction that falls outside of a “business relationship,” is known as an occasional 
transaction. 
 

 
 
By definition it can only apply where a practice-client relationship lacks an expectation 
of an “element of duration.” For this definition to apply, the relationship must be limited 
to a single service provided at a certain point in time.   
 
It will still be necessary to undertake CDD for an occasional transaction where it has a 
value of 15,000 Euros or more. 15,000 Euros relates only to the sums involved in the 
transaction(s) and does not include legal fees or distributions. 
 
Due to the ongoing duties a practice would have in most foreseeable circumstances, 
this definition is not likely to apply to the relationship between a legal practice and a 
client for any transaction. 
 
It may apply in the case of a limited ancillary service, provided as a one-off or in some 
examples of notarial work in particular. Please see Part 2 for more information on 
notarial work. 
 
6.6 Intermediaries, agents or representatives 
 
If your client is represented by an intermediary, agent or representative (i.e., someone 
purporting to represent them), you must comply with R28(10) and identify and verify the 
intermediary's identity and their authority to act on behalf of your underlying client. 
 
Examples of someone purporting to represent might include: 
 
• a parent on behalf of an adult child; 
• an individual not employed by your client; or 
• a situation where the instructing persons authority to instruct is not clear or does not 
make sense. 
 
In the absence of factors that give rise to a concern, an employee of a company would 
not be considered to be ‘purporting to instruct’.  A risk-based approach should be taken 
to the level of identification verification applied.  Authority to instruct can be addressed 
by an engagement letter or equivalent but it should come directly from the underlying 
client (including where instructed by an employee of the company).  
 
Even where someone does not purport to act on someone else’s behalf, you should 
consider if it is possible there may be an underlying client that is the recipient 
(potentially by proxy via another professional service provider) of your services on more 
than a single isolated basis. If you think this is possible, you should satisfy yourself that 
you have identified and verified who the underlying client is or establish a suitable 
reliance arrangement with the professional you are dealing with. 
 
You should ensure you understand who your client relationship is with. There may be 
times when an intermediary is your client (in that your contract is with them) but the 
intermediary’s client is the ultimate beneficiary of your work and advice. The regulations 
make clear that a “beneficial owner” is the individual on whose behalf a transaction is 
being conducted and you should treat such a client as a beneficial owner, including 
undertaking reasonable measures to identify and verify their identity. This is different to 
a situation where an entity refers a client to you (see below.) 
 
Where the intermediary is an entity, you may consider whether you need to undertake 
Ultimate Beneficial Ownership checks on a risk-based approach. 

 
 
 
See 6.14.9 for how to identify and verify individuals in these situations. 
 
6.7 Referrals to another legal practice (or referrals between other entities in scope of 
the regulations) 
 
The difference between the circumstances described in 6.6 and making referrals to 
another practice is described in the below table.  
 
This table relates to solicitors only - for arrangements relating to Barristers and 
Advocates, please consult the relevant section in Part 2.  
Intermediaries, Agents or 
Representatives 
 
Referrals 
If you are instructed by a law firm, or 
other professional intermediary the law 
firm/professional intermediary are your 
client, and you will need to undertake 
CDD on them.  
 
If the effective beneficial owner of the 
advice is that law firm’s/professional 
intermediary’s client, you should 
consider the risks and identify/verify 
their client as you would any other 
ultimate beneficial owner.  
This could include understanding the 
checks the intermediary has carried 
out. 
Where a legal practice or other 
intermediary refers a client to you and 
you have the direct relationship with 
the client, you should treat the referred 
entity as the client and carry out CDD 
on them as the client in the usual way.  
You may wish to consider, having 
regard to the risks (and regulated 
status of the referring entity), whether 
a reliance agreement with the referring 
entity is appropriate in the 
circumstances. 

 
 
 
6.8 Timing of CDD 
 
CDD must be completed before you: 
• deliver substantive work or benefit; 
• permit funds to be deposited in your practice’s client account unless they are 
for fees and disbursements;  
• allow property to be transferred; or  
• allow final agreements to be signed and completed. 
A legal practice should ensure that CDD has been completed as early as possible, before 
any money has been taken from the client, though money on account of costs/fees may be 
accepted on a risk sensitive basis. 
 
Conducting CDD as early as possible also helps you to avoid any delays further along in the 
matter and will help you in your duty to report suspicious activity, at an early stage. This can 
help protect you from needing to submit a suspicious activity report (SAR) seeking a defence 
against money laundering (DAML) to return funds that have been paid into your client 
account, where you have a suspicion the funds may be the proceeds of crime. 
 
R30 requires you to verify your client's identity, the identity of any person purporting to act 
on their behalf and that of any beneficial owner before you establish a business 
relationship or carry out a transaction which amounts to 15,000 Euros or more (subject to 
R30(3)(a)). 
 
 
6.9 What happens when you cannot complete CDD? 
 
R31 provides that if you are unable to complete CDD in time, including identification & 
verification, you must: 
• not carry out a transaction with or for the client through a bank account; 
• not carry out a transaction otherwise than through a bank account; or, 
• terminate the business relationship. 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, you should consider a failure to apply CDD under R28(10) 
(persons acting as agents) as also triggering the above requirements in R31. 
 
If you are unable to complete CDD, you must in addition to terminating any existing business 
relationship consider making a disclosure to the NCA. 
 
You cannot seek consent from the NCA to proceed with a transaction solely because you 
have been unable to complete CDD measures as required by R28 and reporting a matter 
to the NCA is not a substitute for your responsibility to complete CDD. Although you should 
consider making a disclosure to the NCA where you have been unable to complete CDD, 
this does not mean you are automatically required to submit a SAR. For further information 
refer to Section 11. 

 
 
 
6.10 Exceptions to the timing requirement 
There are exceptions to the timing requirement and the prohibition on acting for the client 
until CDD has been completed. 
 
Where there is a delay in completing CDD you should consider why, and whether this 
gives rise to a suspicion which should be disclosed to the NCA. 
 
A practice should document any occasion where CDD was delayed in the matter risk 
assessment and take appropriate mitigatory steps in order to manage any risks this may 
create.  
 
In the event that you think either of the below exceptions apply, you should consider and 
record your reasoning as to why. 
 
However, when acting for a: 
 
• UK company (registered or unregistered as defined in the Unregistered 
Companies Regulations 2009(1)); 
• UK Limited Liability Partnership; or  
• Scottish Partnership 
 
- you must collect proof of registration (e.g., via the client) or an excerpt from the relevant 
register before commencing a business relationship even when relying on an exception to 
the timing requirement. 
 
6.10.1 Exception 1 - Normal conduct of business 
R30(3) provides that verification of the client and the beneficial owner may be completed as 
soon as practicable after contact is first established, during the establishment of the 
business relationship if: 
 
• it is necessary not to interrupt the normal conduct of business; and 
• there is little risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.  
 
This should be considered in the context of the points in 6.8 of this guidance. 
 
If there is little risk of money laundering (due to the nature of the client or transaction) thus 
allowing a delay in CDD completion, the reasons for this view must be included in the 
client and/or matter risk assessment, along with any mitigations you have put in place for 
this. 
 
Consider your Practice Wide Risk Assessment (PWRA) when assessing which work, if 
any, can be undertaken prior to verification being completed. This exception does not 
apply if your matter is an occasional transaction. 
 
 

 
 
6.10.2 Exception 2 - Ascertaining legal position 
 
R31(3) provides that the prohibitions in 31(1) do not apply where: 
’An independent legal professional or other professional adviser is in the course of 
ascertaining the legal position for their client or performing the task of defending or 
representing that client in, or concerning, legal proceedings, including giving advice on the 
institution or avoidance of proceedings.' 
 
We interpret this to mean that this exception does not generally apply to transactional 
work but may be relevant when considering work undertaken as a tax adviser or when 
ascertaining the legal position an anticipation or preparation of early stages of 
transactional work or early stages of representation or provision of legal advice on other 
topics.  
 
6.11 Undertaking CDD on Clients 
 
R28 requires that you must: 
 
• Identify the client and verify their identity on the basis of documents (e.g., passport 
or driver’s license) or information obtained from a reliable source which is 
independent of the client (which may include a digital verification system, subject to 
meeting certain criteria – further details provided under Section 7), unless the 
identity of the client is already known to you and has been verified by you; 
• Identify where there is a beneficial owner who is not the client and take 
reasonable measures to verify the identity so that you are satisfied that you 
know who the beneficial owner is; 
• Take reasonable measures to understand the ownership and control structure of 
the legal person, trust, company, foundation or other similar legal arrangement; 
• Assess, and where appropriate obtain information on the purpose and intended 
nature of the business relationship or occasional transaction; and 
• Conduct ongoing monitoring, scrutinise transactions and make sure CDD 
documents are up to date. 
 
6.12 Identification and verification 
 
Identification  of  a  client or  a  beneficial  owner  is simply  being told  or  otherwise  coming  to 
know a client's identifying details, such as their name and address. 
 
Verification is obtaining evidence which supports this claim of identity.  
 
6.13 A risk-based approach 
 
R28(12) provides that to comply with the requirement to take CDD measures, you must 
reflect: 
• the PWRA (R18); and 
• your assessment of the level of risk arising in any particular case i.e., the 
client/matter risk assessment.
