Source of Funds Requirements

8.1 Source of Funds (SoF) documentation is required for all matters rated MEDIUM or HIGH risk.

8.2 SoF documentation must identify and verify the origin of funds being used for a specific transaction or matter. This includes:

(a) The immediate source of funds (e.g., bank account, mortgage provider);
(b) How the client obtained those funds;
(c) Supporting documentary evidence.

8.3 Third-Party Funding

Where funds are being provided by a third party (i.e., not the client), additional scrutiny is required:

(a) The third party must be identified and their relationship to the client documented;
(b) The source of the third party's funds must be established;
(c) The rationale for third-party funding must be understood and documented;
(d) This automatically adds 2 points to the risk score under the Internal Risk Scoring Model.

8.4 Cross-Border Funds

Where funds originate from outside the UK, fee earners must:

(a) Identify the jurisdiction of origin;
(b) Consider any sanctions or HRTC implications;
(c) Obtain supporting bank documentation;
(d) This adds 1 point to the risk score.
