Risk Scoring Thresholds

4.6 Eventus applies the following risk scoring thresholds to all Client and Matter Level Risk Assessments (CMLRAs):

- LOW RISK: Total score of 0 to 4 points
- MEDIUM RISK: Total score of 5 to 8 points
- HIGH RISK: Total score of 9 or more points

These thresholds have been calibrated based on Eventus' Practice-Wide Risk Assessment and are reviewed annually. The MLRO may adjust scoring or override thresholds in exceptional circumstances, with documented justification.

All risk scores must be calculated using the approved Internal Risk Scoring Model (currently version 3.7). Manual adjustments to scores are not permitted without MLRO approval.
