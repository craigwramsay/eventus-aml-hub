?? EVENTUS AML MANUAL
Combined Internal Risk Scoring Model
Corporate / Non-Natural Persons & Individuals
Version 3.7 – December 2025
(Clarificatory update only – no scoring changes)

VERSION NOTE
v3.7 update
This version incorporates a clarification reflecting the final Eventus Source of Wealth (SoW) and Source of Funds (SoF) forms and the operation of the Eventus AML Compliance Assistant.
Clarification:
Information obtained via the Source of Wealth and Source of Funds records does not introduce new scoring factors. Any elevated risk identified through SoW or SoF analysis must be assessed by reference back to the Client and Matter Level Risk Assessment (CMLRA) and this Internal Risk Scoring Model.
No scores, thresholds, or risk appetite positions have been amended.
(Eventus AML PCPs, §§4, 8, 11; LSAG 2025, §§5.6, 5.13)

PREAMBLE – APPLICATION OF THE MODEL
This Internal Risk Scoring Model must be applied to all Client and Matter Level Risk Assessments (CMLRAs) conducted by Eventus Law Limited.
The model:
* implements a risk-based approach required by the MLR 2017
(MLR 2017, regs. 18, 28);
* reflects Eventus’ documented risk appetite
(Eventus PWRA, §2.4);
* applies fixed numerical scores which must not be altered or re-weighted
(LSAG 2025, §5.13).
Jurisdictional risk clarification
Country of incorporation, residence, or operation is not scored as a standalone factor. Jurisdictional risk is captured through:
* beneficial owner residency;
* exposure to FATF-listed High-Risk Third Countries;
* sanctions exposure; and
* cross-border movement of funds.
(Eventus PWRA, §§2.2–2.3; LSAG 2025, §6.12)
